  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nBedrock is a multi-asset liquidity restaking protocol designed primarily for professional and institutional users. It offers secure and flexible management of staked assets across various blockchains. The project was officially launched in partnership with the infrastructure company RockX, with its public debut and the unveiling of key products taking place in January 2024. Built on a modular, multi-chain architecture—an industry first—Bedrock enables restaking not only on Ethereum but also on Bitcoin (via wrapped assets), IoTeX, and other networks. By early 2025, it had integrated with several ecosystem layers including Babylon, Kernel, Pell, and Satlayer. In 2024, it issued universal tokens (uniBTC, uniETH, uniIOTX) for BTC, ETH, and IOTX. The platform operates on a non-custodial basis, ensuring user control over private keys, reflecting a strong focus on security and institutional standards.\n\nThe core architecture of Bedrock introduces a liquid restaking protocol supporting multiple assets. Users can stake assets such as BTC, ETH, and IOTX, receiving in return liquid tokens—uniBTC, uniETH, uniIOTX—that can be deployed in DeFi protocols or re-staked for additional yield. At the heart of its technical approach is the uniToken standard, a universal tokenized format that relies on increasing token value through growth of the underlying asset and rewards rather than rebasing—meaning it does not change token supply but boosts token worth over time. All reward calculations and validator balances are derived exclusively from on-chain data, deliberately avoiding external oracles to enhance resilience and transparency.\n\nIn terms of cross-chain interoperability, Bedrock employs Hashed Time Lock Contracts (HTLC) and cross-chain relays to facilitate atomic swaps and reliable asset synchronization across different blockchains. For data transmission beyond staking, it uses a system of distributed oracles and a blockchain gateway architecture, though it does not leverage these for reward calculations. To incentivize and retain users, Bedrock introduced the Diamond Points reward system—an tokenized mechanism that rewards long-term holding and participation, reinforcing commitment to the ecosystem.\n\n## Functionality\n\nBedrock provides a comprehensive environment for multi-asset liquid restaking, enabling seamless interactions across diverse blockchains. It allows staking of assets such as BTC, ETH, and IOTX, issuing correlated liquid tokens that represent stake and accrued rewards. These tokens are further integrable into DeFi applications or can be re-staked to generate extra income. The protocol’s design is based on a universal token standard—uniToken—that does not rebalance through supply changes but appreciates in value as the underlying assets grow and rewards accumulate. Security and transparency are prioritized by relying solely on on-chain data, eliminating dependence on external oracles, which mitigates risks associated with data manipulation or oracle failures.\n\nCross-chain operations are secured using HTLCs and relays, enabling atomic swaps with assured consistency. This approach maintains the integrity of assets even during complex multi-step transactions across different chains. The liquid tokens (LRTs) are an integral feature, allowing users flexibility to utilize their staked assets within DeFi or compound their rewards. To motivate ongoing engagement, the protocol offers Diamond Points—an incentivization token reflecting user activity and longevity within the ecosystem.\n\nBedrock adheres to high security standards suitable for institutional deployment, featuring rigorous audits and advanced security measures. Its integration with ecosystem layers like Babylon and EigenLayer allows assets such as uniBTC and uniETH to participate directly in broader cryptoeconomic security protocols, facilitating cross-ecosystem rewards and further protocol robustness.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Multi-Asset Support**: Provides liquid restaking for BTC, ETH, IOTX and other assets via brBTC, uniBTC, uniETH, uniIOTX.\n- **Non-Custodial Infrastructure**: Users retain control of private keys; custody risk is minimized.\n- **Universal Token Standard (uniToken)**: Single-token model representing staked assets and rewards, designed as non-rebasing.\n- **No Oracle Dependency**: All staking reward calculations are performed on-chain without external oracles.\n- **Modular Architecture**: Protocol adaptively integrates new chains and yield sources as industry standards evolve.\n- **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Utilizes HTLCs and relays for secure atomic swaps across different blockchains.\n- **Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs)**: Enable users to restake LRTs into DeFi or earn additional rewards.\n- **Diamond Points Incentive System**: Rewards users for holding and actively using uniTokens over time.\n- **Institutional Security Standards**: Implements advanced security protocols and audits to meet institutional requirements.\n- **Babylon & EigenLayer Integration**: uniBTC and uniETH work directly with major cryptoeconomic security layers for cross-ecosystem rewards.\n\n## Celestia x Bedrock\n\nAs of August 2025, there are no verified facts indicating direct cooperation, integrations, or joint launches between the Celestia project and Bedrock. Official sources, technical documentation, news outlets, and analytical platforms do not report any formal partnership or collaborative development involving both. \n\nCelestia is a modular blockchain project offering data availability as a service aimed at creating scalable, independent blockchains with separated execution and data layers. Since 2022, the project has been actively developing within the modular chains ecosystem, interacting predominantly with rollups and Layer 2 solutions. \n\nThe term \"Bedrock\" primarily refers to two different contexts:  \n- The OP Stack Bedrock, a technology upgrade for Optimism's Layer 2 chains introduced in 2023, designed to build a superchain of interconnected rollups on Ethereum.  \n- Bedrock DeFi, a separate multi-chain protocol for restaking assets such as Bitcoin via wrapped tokens and integrating with Babylon and IoTeX, but with no verified linkage to Celestia.\n\nWhile both projects are prominent within the blockchain infrastructure space and sometimes appear together in industry roundups or trend analyses, there is no evidence of formal integration. Mentions of Celestia in relation to Bedrock or OP Stack are usually indirect—referring to the potential use of Celestia’s data availability layer within modular rollups or L2 solutions, but without official collaboration or shared codebases.\n\nThere are no official announcements, product integrations, or joint releases confirmed by Github repositories, blogs, or official statements from either Celestia, Bedrock Dev, or associated ecosystems. The timeline indicates that Bedrock’s restaking activity and Babylon integrations occurred without any direct reference to Celestia, and similarly, Celestia continues its independent development with active integrations into various rollups."
