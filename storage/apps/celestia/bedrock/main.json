  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nBedrock is a decentralized, multi-asset liquid restaking protocol designed to optimize yield for crypto asset holders while maintaining liquidity and a high level of security. Developed in collaboration with RockX, a reputable firm specializing in blockchain infrastructure, Bedrock officially launched in the first quarter of 2024. Its testnet was introduced in January 2024, followed by the mainnet debut in March 2024. The platform aims to address existing inefficiencies in staking models, particularly for assets like Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies, which often face difficulties in fully participating in DeFi and earning sustainable, multi-layered rewards. Bedrock supports staking and restaking not only for Ethereum but also for Bitcoin and IoTeX, seamlessly integrating with emerging DeFi infrastructure such as Babylon and EigenLayer. Major milestones include forming strategic alliances with staking leaders like Babylon and EigenLayer, implementing institutional-grade security measures, and establishing a dual-token governance and incentive system. As of August 2025, Bedrock has attracted over $50 billion in total value locked and boasts a community of more than 278,000 users worldwide.\n\n## Functionality\n\nAt its core, Bedrock offers liquid restaking—allowing users to stake assets like ETH, BTC, and IOTX and receive equivalent Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) such as uniETH, uniBTC, uniIOTX, and brBTC. These tokens preserve liquidity, permitting their free transfer or deployment within DeFi ecosystems while generating staking rewards. The assets are managed in a non-custodial manner, with user funds held securely by smart contracts rather than centralized entities. Bedrock’s modular architecture facilitates easy integration of new blockchain networks and yield sources. Its Proof of Staked Liquidity (PoSL) mechanism aligns governance with liquidity provision and rewards, incentivizing participants to contribute to deeper liquidity pools and commit over the long term. For instance, Bitcoin holders can restake wrapped BTC (wBTC on Ethereum) into protocols like Babylon to earn native staking incentives alongside additional rewards from partner systems. The tokens are non-rebasing, meaning their value increases through appreciation rather than inflation of token supply, thereby preventing dilution. Governance is managed via a dual-token system: BR, a utility and incentive token, and veBR, which is earned through locking BR tokens and grants voting power. This model, based on community gauge voting, enables transparent allocation of protocol incentives across various asset pools.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Multi-Asset Restaking**: Supports ETH, BTC, and IOTX for staking and restaking with protocols such as Babylon and EigenLayer.\n- **Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs)**: Issues uniETH, uniBTC, uniIOTX, and brBTC, facilitating liquidity and reward earning.\n- **Non-Custodial Architecture**: Assets are securely managed through smart contracts, removing centralized control.\n- **Non-Rebasing Yield Model**: Token values appreciate over time rather than through inflation, avoiding dilution.\n- **Proof of Staked Liquidity (PoSL)**: An innovative incentive mechanism integrating liquidity, governance, and sustainable rewards.\n- **Dual-Token Governance**: Utilizes BR for utility and incentives, and veBR, earned via token locking, for governance voting and enhanced rewards.\n- **Gauge-Based Governance**: Community votes determine reward distribution, ensuring incentive alignment across pools.\n- **Cross-Chain Yield Integration**: Partners with protocols like Babylon, EigenLayer, Kernel, and Pell, enabling layered yield strategies.\n- **Institutional-Grade Security**: Designed with security standards in partnership with RockX, including thoroughly audited smart contracts.\n- **Open Integration Standards**: A modular framework that allows support for new assets and staking layers in the future.\n- **Transparent On-Chain Operations**: All staking activities, governance processes, and reward allocations are recorded transparently on-chain for auditing.\n- **High TVL and User Adoption**: Over $50 billion in total value locked and more than 278,000 users as of August 2025."
