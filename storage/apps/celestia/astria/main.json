  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nAstria is a modular blockchain project designed with the goal of decentralizing the core blockchain infrastructure—specifically, the sequencing layer responsible for ordering transactions before they are committed to the main chain. On April 19, 2023, the project announced a successful funding round totaling $5.5 million, led by prominent investors like 1kx, Delphi Ventures, and Figment Capital. The key technological milestone was the launch of its alpha mainnet on October 28, 2024. Astria positions itself as the first decentralized, shared sequencing layer compatible with both EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and SVM (Solana Virtual Machine), enabling cross-ecosystem development. Its main strategic partner is Celestia; data publication in the network leverages the Celestia token (TIA). Originally conceived as a settlement layer for data aggregation on Celestia, the project has expanded to address scalability and decentralization challenges faced by rollup ecosystems.\n\n## Functionality\n\nAstria provides the infrastructure for building independent layer-two \"rollups\"—scalable blockchain solutions—without relying on a centralized sequencer, which traditionally becomes a single point of failure or a tool for censorship. The mainnet operates as a permissionless platform that multiple rollups can utilize simultaneously, ensuring order of transactions is maintained in a decentralized manner. Thanks to compatibility with both EVM and SVM, Astria facilitates integration with leading blockchain ecosystems, allowing developers to deploy smart contracts in familiar programming languages compatible with these virtual machines. The network features rapid block times, approximately 2 seconds, coupled with single-slot finality, drastically reducing transaction confirmation delays for users and developers. Data publication and availability are managed through Celestia’s Data Availability Layer, while transaction ordering and logic are executed by Astria’s core network.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Decentralized Shared Sequencer**: Offers a decentralized layer for transaction sequencing, eliminating central bottlenecks and enabling cross-chain interoperability.\n- **Multi-VM Compatibility**: Supports both EVM and SVM, broadening integration possibilities across Ethereum and Solana ecosystems.\n- **Celestia Integration**: Utilizes Celestia’s Data Availability Layer for robust data publishing, leveraging the TIA token.\n- **Alpha Mainnet Launch**: The alpha version of the mainnet went live on October 28, 2024.\n- **Censorship Resistance**: Designed to prevent interference in transaction ordering, ensuring trustless execution for rollup applications.\n- **Fast Block Times**: Blocks are produced roughly every 2 seconds, facilitating rapid transaction finality.\n- **One-slot Finality**: Achieves transaction finality within a single slot, reducing rollback risk.\n- **Open Permissionless Network**: Anyone can deploy and operate rollups on Astria without permission barriers.\n- **Flagship EVM for Celestia**: Leading EVM implementation tailored for the modular data availability layer of Celestia.\n- **Attracted $5.5M Investments**: Secured substantial funding from top crypto funds in April 2023.\n- **Modular Plugin Architecture**: Designed as a plugin to embed into external blockchain ecosystems, supporting modular expansion.\n\n## Celestia x Astria\n\nThe relationship between Celestia and Astria is rooted in deep technical integration—Astria’s operation fundamentally depends on Celestia’s infrastructure. Astria is built and functions with the support of Celestia’s Data Availability network, and its core processes rely directly on Celestia’s capabilities, especially for data publication and storage.\n\nAstria officially launched its alpha mainnet on October 28, 2024. Both the project documentation and official announcements emphasize that Astria is the “first Celestia project,” explicitly stating that it could not operate without Celestia Labs, the Celestia Foundation, and the broader Celestia ecosystem. The launch announcement highlights: “Astria is unquestionably the first Celestia project, and it wouldn’t exist without the support of Celestia Labs, the Foundation, and the entire ecosystem.”\n\nThe primary function of Astria is providing a decentralized sequencer layer that delivers fast, secure, and independent transaction ordering for multiple blockchains and rollup solutions. Its core mechanism involves publishing transaction data within the Celestia network using its modular Data Availability infrastructure. This reliance on Celestia’s DA layer improves reliability, scalability, and resilience.\n\nAffirming this dependence, official sources confirm that Astria’s transaction data is published directly into Celestia’s blockchain, utilizing its data publication mechanisms. The project also uses the TIA token for economic interactions within the ecosystem. This relationship was first publicly referenced during the investment round in April 2023, where the strategic goal was explicitly to leverage Celestia’s DA infrastructure for Astria’s rollups.\n\nThe collaboration timeline and milestones include:\n\n- **Spring–Fall 2023**: Development of an alpha prototype of Astria with integrated Celestia DA functionality, supported by initial investments aimed at partnership.  \n- **October 31, 2023**: Launch of Celestia’s mainnet, enabling operational integration.  \n- **October 28, 2024**: Official launch of Astria’s mainnet utilizing Celestia’s Data Availability Layer, with public confirmation of ongoing strategic partnership.\n\nThis collaboration is more than a one-time event; it represents a strategic, ongoing technological alliance. From the outset of Astria’s mainnet launch, the project demonstrated:\n\n- Publishing all transaction data onto Celestia’s blockchain for increased scalability and robustness.  \n- Using the TIA token as an integral part of the ecosystem infrastructure.  \n- Continuous joint R&D efforts to ensure compatibility and collaborative validation of network evolution.\n\nOfficially, this partnership and integration were gradually built from the investment phase in April 2023 to the mainnet launch in October 2024, with each stage reaffirming Astria’s role as a critical component of the Celestia ecosystem. The project is seen as a direct beneficiary of Celestia’s modular data availability infrastructure—serving as one of the practical showcases of Celestia’s capabilities for complex, multi-chain solutions such as rollups, appchains, and sequencer networks."
