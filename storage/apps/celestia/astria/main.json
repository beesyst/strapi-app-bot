  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nAstria is a blockchain project focused on decentralizing the sequencing layer—those critical components responsible for ordering and batching transactions in layer 2 blockchain ecosystems. These sequencers typically act as trusted entities that gather transactions and submit them to the underlying mainnet, such as Ethereum. The core idea behind Astria is to eliminate centralized bottlenecks and censorship risks inherent in many current rollup solutions, where a single trusted sequencer controls transaction order. Positioning itself as the first decentralized, shared sequencing layer for rollups, Astria aims to provide a permissionless, resilient platform that ensures fast, transparent, and censorship-resistant transaction ordering. \n\nThe project was initiated before April 2023 and publicly announced securing $5.5 million in funding from prominent venture firms like 1kx, Delphi Ventures, and Figment Capital. On October 28, 2024, Astria launched its mainnet with an alpha version of its protocol, marking a significant milestone. A key architectural element of Astria is its integration with Celestia, which it uses as a data availability layer to publish and store transaction data. Designed as a modular solution, Astria is compatible with EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and SVM (Solana Virtual Machine), enabling its deployment across various layer 2 networks and rollup protocols.\n\nThe strategic goal of Astria's development team is to offer a unified, permissionless, shared sequencing network that ensures rapid, decentralized processing and guarantees the immutability of transaction orderings, thereby strengthening the security and scalability of the entire ecosystem.\n\n## Functionality\n\nAstria develops a modular, open-access infrastructure that creates a shared decentralized sequencing layer for multiple blockchain protocols, primarily targeting rollup solutions. The Astria sequencer operates in modes compatible with leading standards like EVM and SVM, allowing developers to deploy custom rollups without centralization risks associated with traditional sequencers.\n\nAt the heart of its technical architecture is integration with Celestia, which supplies a scalable data availability and storage layer. While Astria is responsible for maintaining a decentralized sequence of transactions, the actual data is published on Celestia, enabling high throughput and resilient data accessibility. The network offers quick block times of around 2 seconds, achieving “single-slot finality”—meaning each transaction is finalized quickly and with minimal delay.\n\nUnlike conventional rollup environments where the sequencer might be a centralized or semi-trusted entity, Astria’s approach ensures that the sequencing process is open, permissionless, and accessible to many independent rollup ecosystems. This decentralization reduces censorship and single points of failure, bolstering security and trustworthiness.\n\nAmong its tools is Astria EVM—a Ethereum-compatible sidechain demonstrating how shared sequencing can be utilized for deploying decentralized applications (dApps) on Celestia. Since late October 2024, the alpha version of this environment has been available for testing, signaling the project’s readiness for broader adoption.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Shared Sequencer Layer**: A single, decentralized sequencing layer utilized simultaneously by multiple rollup networks.\n- **EVM & SVM Compatibility**: Supports deployment on both Ethereum Virtual Machine and Solana Virtual Machine environments.\n- **Integration with Celestia**: Utilizes Celestia as a scalable layer for data availability and storage.\n- **Fast Block Times**: Blocks are generated approximately every 2 seconds, enabling quick confirmation times.\n- **Single-Slot Finality**: Finalizes transactions within each slot, substantially reducing confirmation delays.\n- **Open, Permissionless Network**: Allows any developer to integrate and deploy rollups without needing approval.\n- **$5.5M Funding (April 2023)**: Secured investments from 1kx, Delphi Ventures, and Figment Capital.\n- **Modular Plugin Architecture**: Designed as a flexible, modular protocol that can be plugged into existing infrastructure seamlessly.\n- **No Single Point of Failure**: Fully decentralized sequencing avoids vulnerabilities related to central control or censorship.\n- **Flagship Astria EVM for Celestia**: A reference Ethereum Virtual Machine deployment optimized for Celestia-backed rollups.\n\n## Celestia x Astria\n\nThe relationship between Celestia and Astria is rooted in deep technical integration. Astria leverages the Celestia infrastructure as its primary data availability layer when building its ecosystem of optimistic rollups. This setup aims to enhance scalability, decentralization, and ease of launching new blockchains, all within Celestia’s modular architecture.\n\nAstria positions itself as a shared execution layer—often called the \"Shared Sequencer Network\"—that benefits from Celestia’s data availability features. According to official documentation and public statements, Astria relies on Celestia as its Data Availability (DA) layer, ensuring the secure and decentralized publication of transaction data. This architecture, dubbed “Shared Sequencer Network backed by Celestia DA,” enables rollups and other layer 2 solutions to utilize a common, resilient transaction ordering layer while relying on Celestia's robust data publication system.\n\nThe first public mention of the integration came by April 2023, where Astria's technical architecture explicitly described how it leverages Celestia's DA layer to host rollup data efficiently and securely. This partnership was further emphasized as Astria introduced tools and reference node implementations compatible with Celestia, facilitating quick rollup deployment without building entirely from scratch.\n\nIn the lead-up to the mainnet launch of Celestia on October 31, 2023, Astria announced private testing of its sequencer network designed to operate within the Celestia ecosystem. Post-launch, both projects continued close collaboration: Astria extended support for various rollups utilizing Celestia’s data layer, sharing development tools and templates to streamline integration.\n\nBy early 2024, both teams maintained active engagement, with Astria incorporating Celestia into its core infrastructure and publicly endorsing Celestia as the preferred data availability solution. Joint events, cooperative technical workshops, and integrated code repositories underscore their strategic partnership, which has only strengthened through 2024 and into 2025."
