  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nAstria is a decentralized shared sequencer network designed to eliminate the reliance on centralized orderers within the blockchain ecosystem. Officially unveiled on April 4, 2023, the project announced a seed funding round of $5.5 million led by Maven 11, with participation from 1kx, Delphi Ventures, and Figment Capital. The aim of Astria is to empower developers to deploy their own censorship-resistant rollups without depending on a central entity to sequence transactions. In October 2024, Astria successfully launched its mainnet, marking a significant move toward decentralizing the transaction ordering process and establishing a truly community-driven infrastructure.\n\n## Functionality\n\nAstria functions as an intermediate blockchain utilizing the CometBFT consensus algorithm (formerly Tendermint) to deliver swift finality and prevent chain splits. Its core purpose is to order transactions for various rollup solutions without executing them directly, allowing each rollup to maintain its sovereignty. During the consensus process, proposer nodes generate a block containing grouped transactions and produce a commitment for each rollup_id. This commitment undergoes validation and approval by the majority of network nodes, ensuring that rollup nodes retrieve only the data relevant to them, rather than the entire block. To ensure data availability, Astria integrates seamlessly with Celestia, which supports light nodes capable of verifying data availability through sampling techniques, removing the need to download entire blocks for validation.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Decentralized Transaction Ordering**: Provides a distributed mechanism for sequencing transactions across multiple rollup solutions.\n- **Fast Finality**: Utilizes CometBFT to confirm transactions rapidly with finality guarantees.\n- **Rollup Sovereignty**: Ensures each rollup retains control over its state and transaction ordering.\n- **Celestia Data Availability Integration**: Offers reliable data access through an integrated layer with Celestia.\n- **Inter-Blockchain Communication Support**: Enables interoperability with other blockchains via IBC protocols.\n- **Modular Architecture**: Facilitates easy integration and customization of network components for developers.\n- **Compatibility with Multiple Virtual Machines**: Supports various execution environments, including EVM.\n- **Transaction Ordering Without Execution**: Focuses solely on sequencing, reducing processing load and congestion.\n- **Open Source Transparency**: Maintains a community-driven, auditable codebase.\n- **Multi-Rollup Support**: Capable of servicing multiple rollup solutions simultaneously, increasing network efficiency and flexibility.\n\n## Celestia x Astria\n\nThe Celestia and Astria projects are closely intertwined in advancing modular blockchain architectures aimed at scaling, securing, and decentralizing dApps. Celestia provides a modular blockchain framework that allows the deployment and scaling of independent chains, while Astria concentrates on creating a decentralized transaction sequencing layer specifically for Rollup solutions.\n\nIn October 2022, the Celestia Foundation raised $55 million in a funding round led by Bain Capital Crypto and Polychain Capital to support the development of modular blockchain networks. The launch of Celestia mainnet on October 31, 2023, marked a crucial milestone in the evolution of modular blockchain solutions. This modular approach facilitates flexible, scalable, and trust-minimized blockchain infrastructure.\n\nAstria complements this ecosystem by developing a decentralized transaction ordering layer that multiple Rollup platforms can share, enhancing resilience against censorship, enabling faster block finalization, and maintaining cross-network compatibility. The integration of Celestia as a data availability layer ensures reliable and accessible data for Rollup implementations.\n\nA notable example of this synergy in action is Forma, the first sovereign Rollup built on Astria’s stack, utilizing Celestia for data availability. Forma is compatible with EVM, fully decentralized, and allows users to deploy their own on-chain applications. Currently, Forma operates on its dedicated Astria sequencing layer (forma-net), comprising four nodes running CometBFT consensus. Data from forma-net is relayed to the main Celestia network, with plans to migrate Forma fully onto Astria once its mainnet is operational. Forma’s network uses the TIA token for gas fees and is poised to evolve within this integrated ecosystem.\n\nThis collaboration between Celestia and Astria exemplifies how modular architecture combined with decentralized sequencing can foster scalable, secure, and censorship-resistant solutions for decentralized applications, paving the way for a more open and resilient blockchain future."
