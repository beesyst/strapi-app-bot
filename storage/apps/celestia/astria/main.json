  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nAstria is an infrastructure-focused crypto project designed to support networks of modular and rollup blockchains through its original consensus layer called the Shared Sequencer Network. Astria Labs was established in July 2022, bringing together a team experienced in blockchain scalability and modular architectures. The project’s public unveiling and technical roadmap arrived on February 23, 2023, marking Astria’s entry as a pivotal solution dedicated to streamlining the launch, operation, and decentralization of rollup solutions—avoiding the pitfalls of centralized sequencer architectures. In September 2023, Astria secured $5.5 million in a seed funding round led by Maven 11, highlighting significant interest from leading VCs and tech startups. Astria is developed as an open-source initiative, with all major releases actively updated on GitHub. The current system is grounded on three main components: the Astria Shared Sequencer (a standalone network leveraging Tendermint Core consensus), Astria EVM (a rollup implementation ensuring compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem), and integration with data availability networks—most prominently Celestia—for scalable and secure data storage.\n\n## Functionality\n\nAstria operates as a separate sequencer network, offering transaction ordering and inclusion as a service for any rollup blockchain, and fully decoupling consensus from execution using a modular design. Through the Astria Shared Sequencer, any rollup can access decentralized transaction sequencing without the need to launch and maintain its own, often centralized, sequencer. This system empowers applications to deliver trust-minimized MEV extraction and supports atomic cross-rollup transactions. The protocol is purpose-built on a modified Tendermint Core to provide fast finality, working with off-chain data storage by outsourcing data availability to external networks like Celestia. The first Astria public testnet, which allowed developers to natively integrate their own rollups with the Shared Sequencer Network, launched on July 26, 2023. By October 2023, the devnet went live with active integration of EVM tooling. Thanks to this design, Astria significantly lowers the barrier to entry for both EVM and non-EVM rollups—delivering instant finality, scalable execution, and cross-chain interoperability, all without requiring each project to build its own consensus infrastructure or faced the user isolation common among certain L2 ecosystems.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Shared Sequencer Network**: Provides a decentralized sequencer infrastructure for any rollup\n- **Modular Architecture**: Separates consensus and execution to optimize scalability and resiliency\n- **Fast Finality**: Utilizes Tendermint Core for rapid transaction finalization\n- **Data Availability Integration**: Integrates with Celestia for scalable and secure data storage\n- **EVM Compatibility**: Astria EVM enables rollup networks compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem\n- **Trust-minimized MEV**: Implements a democratic, non-custodial approach to MEV extraction\n- **Cross-Rollup Atomicity**: Natively supports atomic transactions between all Astria-based rollups\n- **Open Source**: Fully open codebase actively maintained on GitHub\n- **Rapid Rollup Deployment**: Infrastructure streamlines and accelerates new rollup launches\n- **Multi-language SDKs**: Tooling and SDKs available for multiple programming languages\n\n## Celestia x Astria\n\nThe connection between Celestia and Astria is deep and multifaceted, as evidenced by several official announcements and media discussions in the crypto space. Both projects are at the forefront of modular blockchain development, each taking on network specialization in ways that naturally complement the other's strengths.\n\nCelestia is a decentralized blockchain that launched its mainnet on October 31, 2023. Its core mission is to deliver a scalable, reliable Data Availability (DA) layer, letting other blockchains leverage its network for storing and distributing block data. Celestia positions itself as the first modular data availability network, splitting transaction execution from both consensus and data storage.\n\nAstria was announced in December 2022 as a protocol delivering a Shared Sequencer Network—a decentralized layer for sequencing transactions across rollups that build on top of Celestia and similar DA solutions. Astria's defining feature is its focus on shared sequencing, vastly simplifying and decentralizing transaction submission for various modular rollups. This fosters better interoperability and counteracts the centralization typical for independently operated rollup sequencers.\n\nFrom day one, Astria’s architecture was built for compatibility with the Celestia DA layer. On April 20, 2023, Astria’s team officially announced that its Coordinated Rollups Testnet would operate atop Celestia as the primary DA layer. This enabled both users and developers on the Astria testnet to store rollup block data directly within the Celestia network—one of the first public demonstrations of Celestia integrated with an independent modular execution solution.\n\nJune 2023 marked the launch of Astria’s public testnet, which continued using Celestia as its backbone DA layer. The Astria Sequencer GitHub repository also officially lists support for Celestia DA, illustrating that this integration is fundamental to the project and not merely experimental.\n\nFollowing Celestia's mainnet debut in November 2023, the Astria community congratulated the Celestia team, reaffirming the ongoing direct integration—now with Astria rollups able to utilize Celestia mainnet for block data. Astria’s official documentation includes walkthroughs for deploying shared sequencer rollups using Celestia.\n\nIn January 2024, Astria and Celestia jointly announced the successful launch of the first five independent rollups using Astria's testnet and Celestia's data availability layer, a clear showcase of parallel rollups operating via a unified sequencer network and DA layer.\n\nArchitecturally, Astria’s whitepaper (April 2023) confirms an “execution-neutral” approach, although Celestia is highlighted as the default and preferred option for data availability, and the rollout scheme is centered on proof-of-availability from Celestia.\n\nFrom Celestia’s perspective, Astria is frequently highlighted as a key partner within its rollup ecosystem. As of late 2023, Astria appears in the official Celestia ecosystem directory under “Rollups & Stack” as a project tackling shared sequencing alongside Celestia DA.\n\nAs of March-April 2024, Astria continues to operate in public testnet, preparing for mainnet deployment on Celestia as soon as its own mainnet is live. On March 20, 2024, Astria announced a transition to “permissionless” mode on its testnet, reinforcing its commitment to open integration and public interaction among rollups using Celestia."
