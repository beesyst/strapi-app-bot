  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nAstria is a decentralized transaction sequencing network designed to eliminate reliance on centralized sequencers within the blockchain ecosystem. Officially introduced on April 4, 2023, the project announced a seed funding round of $5.5 million led by Maven 11, with participation from 1kx, Delphi Ventures, and Figment Capital. On July 1, 2024, Astria closed a strategic funding round totaling $12.5 million, led by dba and Placeholder VC, with investors including RockawayX, Maven 11, 1kx, Bankless Ventures, Figment Capital, and others. The mainnet launched on October 28, 2024, following the successful production of the first block at 4:20 PM Central Time on October 25, 2024.\n\n## Functionality\n\nAstria offers a decentralized layer for transaction ordering that enables multiple rollups to share a unified sequencer network. This setup provides resistance to censorship, rapid block finality, and cross-rollup atomic composability, all while maintaining each rollup’s sovereignty. The network employs CometBFT (formerly Tendermint) as its consensus engine, ensuring decentralized leadership selection and single-slot finality, which prevents forks and simplifies chain logic for rollups. As a \"lazy\" sequencer, Astria orders transactions without executing them, allowing rollups to select their preferred execution environment, be it EVM, SVM, or a custom virtual machine. Transaction data is published to the Celestia data availability layer, ensuring data accessibility and supporting light clients.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Decentralized Sequencing**: Ensures resistance to censorship and fault tolerance.\n- **Fast Confirmations**: Provides blockchain finality in approximately two seconds.\n- **Cross-Rollup Atomicity**: Guarantees atomic transaction inclusion across multiple rollups.\n- **Rollup Sovereignty**: Allows rollups to operate independently and choose their preferred execution environment.\n- **Integration with Celestia**: Utilizes Celestia for data availability and support for light clients.\n- **IBC Support**: Facilitates communication between different chains.\n- **No Native Token**: Does not have its own token; uses TIA for gas payments.\n- **Scalability**: Can support numerous rollups without increasing validator load.\n- **Execution Flexibility**: Developers can choose any execution environment for their rollups.\n- **Easy Deployment**: Simplifies the process of launching decentralized rollups.\n\n## Celestia x Astria\n\nThe projects Celestia and Astria are closely intertwined in advancing modular blockchain solutions aimed at enhancing scalability, performance, and decentralization. Celestia offers a modular architecture for deploying and scaling blockchains, while Astria focuses on establishing a decentralized sequencing layer for rollup solutions, leveraging Celestia’s data availability infrastructure.\n\nIn October 2022, the Celestia Foundation raised $55 million in funding led by Bain Capital Crypto and Polychain Capital to launch its modular blockchain network, enabling anyone to deploy their own chain. \n\nAstria, meanwhile, develops a modular blockchain that provides a shared sequencing layer for various rollup platforms. This approach allows multiple rollups to utilize a decentralized sequencer network, ensuring censorship resistance, fast finality, and cross-chain compatibility. The project relies on Celestia’s infrastructure for data availability, enabling rollups to verify and confirm transactions with high confidence.\n\nOne notable collaboration is Forma, the first sovereign rollup built on Astria’s stack with Celestia as its data availability layer. Forma is EVM-compatible, decentralized, and designed for users to create on-chain applications. It currently operates on its own Astria-based sequence layer (forma-net), consisting of four Astria sequencer nodes running CometBFT for consensus. The sequencer relays blobs to the main Celestia network, paying gas with TIA tokens. After launching its mainnet, Forma plans to migrate onto Astria’s main network.\n\nThe partnership between Celestia and Astria centers on integrating Celestia’s modular architecture with Astria’s decentralized sequencing layer, fostering the development of more efficient, scalable, and resilient blockchain solutions."
