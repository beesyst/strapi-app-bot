  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nAstria is a modular blockchain project designed to deliver a decentralized shared sequencer network, enabling multiple rollups to utilize a unified, censorship-resistant sequencing layer. This setup ensures fast block confirmations, censorship resistance, and atomic cross-rollup composability, all while preserving each rollup’s sovereignty. Officially announced on April 4, 2023, Astria revealed that it closed a seed funding round totaling $5.5 million, led by Maven 11 with participation from 1kx, Delphi Digital, Lemniscap, and other investors. The core aim of Astria is to empower developers to deploy censorship-resistant rollups without depending on centralized sequencers. To achieve this, Astria leverages Celestia as its data availability layer, providing scalable and secure infrastructure.\n\n## Functionality\n\nThe backbone of Astria's operation is a decentralized network of sequencers built on CometBFT (formerly Tendermint), a Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm. This network performs transaction ordering for different rollups without executing the transactions themselves, adopting a “lazy” sequencing approach. This model maintains rollup sovereignty and offers greater flexibility in execution environments. \n\nAstria also supplies integrated tools, including the Astria Stack—comprising the Execution API and Astria-geth—to streamline developers' integration with the decentralized sequencing layer. For instance, Forma, the first sovereign rollup built on Astria Stack, was launched in May 2024. It utilizes these tools to deliver low-cost transactions and fast block times—particularly advantageous for NFT-related applications.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Decentralized Sequencing**: Provides a trust-minimized, permissionless transaction ordering system for multiple rollups.\n- **Lazy Sequencing**: Sequencers only order transactions without executing them, preserving rollup sovereignty.\n- **CometBFT Consensus**: Uses the robust CometBFT consensus engine for rapid finality and security.\n- **Astria Stack**: A comprehensive suite of developer tools for seamless rollup integration.\n- **Execution API**: A standard interface for accessing deterministic blockchain state information from Astria blocks.\n- **Astria-geth**: A modified go-ethereum client optimized for compatibility with the EVM.\n- **Forma Rollup**: The inaugural sovereign rollup on Astria Stack, operational since May 2024.\n- **Celestia Integration**: Utilizes Celestia for scalable data availability and dissemination.\n- **Fast Block Times**: Achieves approximately 2-second block confirmation times with finality in a single slot.\n- **Shared Sequencer Network**: Enables numerous rollups to share a common sequencing infrastructure.\n- **Censorship Resistance**: Ensures transaction and data censorship resistance through decentralization.\n- **Atomic Cross-Rollup Composability**: Guarantees secure, atomic interoperability among different rollups.\n- **Permissionless Deployment**: Rollups can be deployed freely, similar to smart contracts.\n- **High Throughput**: Supports large volumes of transactions across rollups.\n- **Sovereign Rollups**: Facilitates full autonomy and control over individual rollups.\n- **Modular Architecture**: Designed with modularity for flexible customization and scaling.\n- **IBC Support**: Compatible with inter-blockchain communication for cross-network interoperability.\n- **Data Availability Sampling**: Ensures data integrity and scalability using Celestia’s sampling techniques.\n- **Rollup-as-a-Service**: Offers rollup deployment solutions as a managed service.\n- **EVM Compatibility**: Supports Ethereum Virtual Machine, enabling existing

Celestia provides a flexible and scalable data availability layer, enabling developers to build scalable decentralized applications (dApps). Astria complements this by offering a dedicated sequencing layer that simplifies the deployment of decentralized rollups.\n\nThrough this collaboration, Astria has integrated its orchestration technology with Celestia, utilizing Celestia’s data availability infrastructure for transaction data dissemination. This integration allows rollup solutions built on Astria to efficiently store and share transaction data via Celestia's network, ensuring high scalability and decentralization. Official sources confirm this partnership, although specific dates for integration milestones or joint launches have not been publicly disclosed."
