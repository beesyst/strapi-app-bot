  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nOtterSec, branded as OtterSec on osec.io, positions itself as a team of white-hat security researchers specializing in the auditing of smart contracts and blockchain protocol security. The firm offers comprehensive services, including audits, penetration testing, and remediation support to guide fixes through to retesting. It emphasizes deep technical expertise across multiple blockchain layers to protect decentralized systems.\n\nKey metrics highlight the impact of OtterSec's work: over thirty-six billion dollars in on-chain value secured, and more than one billion dollars in vulnerabilities fixed. The firm notes having completed 120+ audits and maintains a public catalog of reports for transparency. These figures are presented publicly on the company's site.\n\nCorporate history shows that the original OtterSec entity was registered as OtterSec LLC in Wyoming on February 8, 2022. Court documents record a sequence of corporate restructurings and asset transfers to Otter Audits LLC and RC Security LLC on September 13, 2022, followed by the dissolution filing of OtterSec on September 27, 2022 and a dissolution certificate issued on October 6, 2022.\n\n## Functionality\n\nOtterSec delivers comprehensive auditing services, including smart contract analysis, audits of protocol code and infrastructure, and the identification and verification of exploited vulnerabilities. The team also provides remediation guidance and retesting to ensure vulnerabilities are effectively closed. This holistic approach supports secure deployment and ongoing resilience for blockchain systems.\n\nThe firm emphasizes deep multi-chain expertise and collaborates with Layer-1 ecosystems such as Solana, Sui, Near, and Aptos, as reflected in its service descriptions and client references. This cross-chain focus enables tailored audits across diverse architectures and consensus models. Additional technical materials and case studies underpin its offerings.\n\nIn addition to commercial audits, OtterSec publishes technical resources and maintains an active GitHub repository with tooling for auditors and researchers, including Solana analysis tools and Capture-The-Flag frameworks. One notable release is the Binary Ninja plugin bn-ebpf-solana, published publicly and linked to a reverse engineering guide. These open resources illustrate the staff's commitment to practical security tooling.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Security Audits (smart contracts & protocol)**: Provides auditing of smart contracts, review of protocol code, and infrastructure pentests; the service profile is published on the official site.\n- **Key Metrics & Reporting**: Publicly cites $36.82B+ secured TVL, $1.00B+ vulnerabilities fixed, 120+ projects audited, and maintains a Notion catalog of reports.\n- **Founding & Corporate Timeline**: Initially registered as OtterSec LLC on February 8, 2022; court materials document the formation of Otter Audits LLC and RC Security LLC on September 13, 2022, the dissolution filing of OtterSec on September 27, 2022, and the dissolution certificate on October 6, 2022.\n- **Open-source Tooling**: Active GitHub organization with repositories for Solana analysis, CTF frameworks, and verification tools, including bn-ebpf-solana.\n- **Published Research & Blog**: Maintains a technical blog featuring vulnerability disclosures and research notes; examples with dates are available on the blog page.\n- **Team Composition**: The team page lists executives and auditors/developers, including Robert Chen as CEO and Jun Choi as COO.\n\n## Monad x Osec\n\nOsec (brand on the osec.io domain, presented as OtterSec) positions itself as an auditor and security specialist for smart contracts and blockchain infrastructure; on the homepage the line Security audits that protect blockchain ideas appears, and the blog contains dated posts such as Cosmos Security: An Otter's Guide dated June 10, 2025. This branding alignment signals OtterSec's core competency and publication activity.\n\nMonad publishes ecosystem, programs, and product update information on its official site. A relevant example is Announcing Monad’s OCSF Templates! published June 16, 2025, which showcases formats for logs and integrations designed for SecOps workflows.\n\nOn Monad's Founder Residency page for OtterSec, the firm is listed as a supporter, with Robert Chen associated with OtterSec. The supporters page was accessible at residency.monad.xyz/supporters as of August 2025. There are no publicly issued press releases, audit reports, technical blog posts, or product pages documenting an official Monad audit of OtterSec or a joint product launch between the two organizations in publicly verifiable channels. The relevant pages on Monad and OtterSec remain accessible for verification."
