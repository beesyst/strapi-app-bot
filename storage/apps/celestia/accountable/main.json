  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nAccountable is a startup positioning itself as a confidential platform for verifying financial data for the cryptocurrency lending market, founded in 2024. It publicly announced a seed round of $2.3 million on December 30, 2024, with media coverage on December 30–31, 2024.\n\nThe product roadmap unfolds in stages: V1 Data Platform with live balance verification and concentration metrics, marking the MVP onboarding of initial customers. V2 envisions transforming into a central hub for comprehensive lending solutions.\n\nThe platform emphasizes practical utility for lenders and institutional clients while preserving cryptographic privacy. In public disclosures, the project references Zero-Knowledge TLS and fully homomorphic encryption as core privacy technologies.\n\nUnderscoring momentum, the team reportedly comprised around eight people at the public announcement. The V1 iteration was developed and tested with bootstrap support from Maven11, and corporate communications indicated plans for a subsequent funding round in the second quarter of 2025.\n\n## Functionality\n\nAccountable connects custodial and exchange accounts to generate verified credit reports and aggregated financial slices that the user can share selectively with counterparties without exposing API keys or wallet addresses. The platform employs a combination of zero-knowledge techniques, including zkTLS for secure data transfer and other cryptographic methods such as fully homomorphic encryption to prove the accuracy of disclosed figures without revealing underlying data.\n\nUse cases include real-time solvency checks for undercollateralized lending, proof-of-reserve attestations for exchanges and stablecoin issuers, and reporting for fund administrators, auditors, and prime brokers. Pilot integrations with institutional counterparties are mentioned as in-progress.\n\nThe current release (V1) provides live verification of balances and exchange-level concentrations to support lending decisions. The roadmap envisions V2 as a central hub for comprehensive credit solutions with an expanded set of financial services.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Privacy‑Preserving Verification**: Generates verifiable proofs of assets, liabilities and trading exposures without disclosing API keys or wallet addresses.\n- **zkTLS Transport**: Uses Zero‑Knowledge Transport Layer Security to transmit verifiable data between parties while preserving confidentiality.\n- **Fully Homomorphic Encryption**: Applies fully homomorphic encryption to enable computation over encrypted financial data, reducing data exposure.\n- **Real-time Verification (V1)**: Provides live verification of balances and concentration metrics across trading venues to support credit decisions.\n- **Roadmap to Lending Hub (V2)**: Evolving from a data platform to a central hub for comprehensive lending solutions with an expanded feature set.\n- **Proof-of-Reserve Use Case**: Enables providing reserve attestations for exchanges and stablecoin issuers without revealing granular asset breakdowns.\n- **Multi-venue Connectivity**: Connects custodial providers, centralized exchanges and DeFi platforms to aggregate risk and concentration.\n- **Institutional Integrations**: Pilots and announced integrations with institutional players, including notable counterparties.\n- **Bootstrapped MVP Support**: The current product iteration was developed and partially backed by Maven11.\n- **Seed Financing (Dec 30, 2024)**: Seed round closed at $2.3 million, led by MitonC and Zee Prime Capital; participants include Maven11, Moonhill Capital and others.\n- **No Native Token (as reported)**: Public profiles indicate no native token at the time of coverage.\n- **Cross-chain Scope (30+ chains)**: Described as supporting multi-bank/multi-chain aggregation, with coverage across over 30 networks.\n\n## Monad x Accountable\n\nThe Monad Madness page for Madness New York 2024 lists Accountable as a participant for the event held from October 2 to October 4, 2024, with the project appearing among teams and nominations, including the Community Choice category.\n\nThe Monad About page formally announces Monad Madness, the program’s pitch competition, with a publication dated August 26, 2024, establishing the competition framework in which Accountable later participated.\n\nGate.io’s ecosystem overview describes Accountable as a credit information verification platform within the Monad ecosystem and outlines the project’s role in verifying credit information within Monad’s framework.\n\nThe Project Playground event listing confirms that Accountable was among projects presented at the event, alongside Electric Capital and ShardLab, underscoring participation in Monad-related activities."
