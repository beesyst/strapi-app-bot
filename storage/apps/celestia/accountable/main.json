  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nAccountable is a startup operating in crypto data and crypto lending, positioning itself as a trusted layer for digital finance with a focus on private verification of assets, liabilities, and credit risk in real time. The company was founded in 2024 by co-founders Wojtek Pawlowski and Ioan Moldovan. Public profiles confirm the 2024 founding year and identify the founders. The team is described as small, with plans to pursue a subsequent funding round in 2025.\n\nAccountable closed a seed round totaling approximately $2.3 million at the end of December 2024, with the announcement made on December 30–31, 2024. The round was led by MitonC and Zee Prime Capital, with angel investors including Darius Rugys of Maven 11 and DCBuilder. Public sources indicate a compact startup team and plans for a follow-on funding round in 2025.\n\nBeyond its marketing site and demo application, Accountable publicly proclaims the use of advanced cryptographic technologies—zkTLS, zero‑knowledge proofs, and fully homomorphic encryption—to transfer and verify sensitive financial data without exposing the data itself. These technologies enable privacy-preserving verification of financial positions and exposures.\n\nThe architecture includes secure enclaves for private input processing and multi‑chain data aggregation, and it integrates with external data providers to form a comprehensive picture of a counterparty’s financial state from both on-chain and off‑chain sources. This setup supports real‑time verification of reserves and obligations for exchanges and stablecoin issuers.\n\n## Functionality\n\nThe Accountable platform collects and aggregates data from centralized and decentralized accounts, including exchanges, custodians, wallets, and other sources. It provides a tool to generate credit risk and proof-of-reserves reports that counterparties can verify without access to raw open data. Users retain control over which data is shared and with whom, and verifications are performed through cryptographic proofs, eliminating the need to share API keys or wallet addresses with third parties. The system is designed to preserve privacy while enabling independent verification by counterparties.\n\nTech stack and architecture include transmitting proofs via the zkTLS protocol, employing zero-knowledge proofs and fully homomorphic encryption for calculations over encrypted data, and using isolated secure enclaves for processing private inputs. These components enable ongoing, real-time verification of reserves and obligations for exchanges and issuers of stablecoins. Public materials also indicate multi-chain support and integration with external data providers, enabling the formation of a comprehensive financial picture based on both on-chain and off-chain sources. This broad data mosaic supports more robust risk assessments.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Privacy-preserving Verification**: Verifies assets, liabilities and exposure without revealing raw account data using zero-knowledge proofs and related cryptography.\n- **Zero-Knowledge Transport Layer Security (zkTLS)**: Uses zkTLS to transmit verifiable attestations between Web2 endpoints and blockchain environments while keeping inputs confidential.\n- **Proof-of-Reserves / Proof-of-Solvency**: Enables continuous, real-time proof-of-reserves and solvency reports for exchanges and stablecoin issuers without open-sourcing full holdings.\n- **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) Support**: Employs homomorphic techniques to compute aggregate metrics over encrypted off-chain data for risk scoring.\n- **Secure Enclaves for Sensitive Computation**: Uses isolated execution environments to ingest private inputs and produce cryptographic proofs without leaking secrets.\n- **Multi-chain Data Aggregation**: Aggregates on-chain data across multiple networks, and supports more than 30 networks.\n- **API-key-free Attestation**: Provides attestations and credit reports that do not require sharing custodial API keys or wallet addresses with counterparties.\n- **Real-time Credit Reporting Dashboard**: Produces live credit risk reports and dashboards for borrowers and lenders, with controls over the scope of data disclosed.\n- **YieldApp / Productized Yield Feed**: Offers a product-level YieldApp and waitlist for aggregating verified yields.\n- **Partnership Integrations (e.g., vlayer)**: Integrates with vlayer for zkTLS-based web attestations, with a Noon Capital case announced to deliver verifiable financial transparency.\n\n## Monad x Accountable\n\nMonad officially published onboarding guidance for connecting to the public testnet, the Monad Testnet, on 2025-02-19; the page and accompanying announcement describe the public testnet launch and the catalog of ecosystem applications available for testing. \n\nIn Monad’s official documentation, in the Account Abstraction section, providers of infrastructure (bundlers, WaaS and related components) that support the Monad Testnet are listed, with details on supported networks and developer instructions.\n\nAccountable is documented as a standalone company and product in industry publications; The Block reported the seed round and described the product as a zk-focused platform for creditworthiness verification and secure attestation of linked accounts.\n\nIndependent media resources and Monad testnet project catalogs note Accountable as a listed project within the Monad Testnet ecosystem; some reviews mention the domain game.accountable.capital among the dApps offering testnet interactions."
