  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nEclipse is an innovative Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to significantly boost the performance and scalability of decentralized applications (dApps). Launched in 2022, the project quickly attracted attention for its unique architecture that combines the best aspects of Ethereum’s security with Solana’s speed. In March 2024, Eclipse successfully closed a Series A funding round, raising $50 million from top-tier investors such as Placeholder and Hack VC, bringing total funding to $65 million. The mainnet went live in November 2024, providing developers with a robust platform to build high-throughput, low-cost dApps.\n\n## Functionality\n\nEclipse’s core architecture is modular, integrating several key components to deliver high performance without compromising security. Ethereum functions as the settlement layer, ensuring decentralized finality and robustness. The execution layer is powered by the Solana Virtual Machine, allowing for parallel transaction processing that vastly outperforms traditional EVM-based chains. To maintain data availability and scalability, Eclipse collaborates with Celestia, which handles the storage and dissemination of transaction data efficiently and cost-effectively. For network integrity, Eclipse employs zero-knowledge fraud proofs via RISC Zero, enabling the detection and correction of invalid transactions without re-executing them on-chain, thus enhancing security and trustworthiness.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) Execution**: Enables parallel transaction processing for high throughput.\n- **Ethereum Settlement Layer**: Provides security and decentralization through Ethereum-based finality.\n- **Data Availability via Celestia**: Uses Celestia’s modular architecture for scalable and cost-efficient data storage.\n- **Zero-Knowledge Fraud Proofs**: Implements RISC Zero for fraud detection, enhancing network security.\n- **High Transaction Throughput**: Achieves over 100,000 transactions per second through parallel processing.\n- **Low Transaction Fees**: Ensures minimal costs, making dApps accessible to all users.\n- **Modular Blockchain Architecture**: Separates execution, settlement, and data availability layers for optimized operation.\n- **Developer-Friendly Environment**: Supports programming in Rust and Python, along with development tools like Anchor.\n- **Interoperability**: Provides native bridges for seamless asset transfer between Ethereum, Solana, and Eclipse.\n- **Robust Security Measures**: Incorporates advanced cryptographic proofs and mechanisms to safeguard the network.\n\n## Celestia x Eclipse\n\nLaunched in 2022 by Neil Somani, Eclipse is a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum that employs the Solana Virtual Machine for transaction execution. The project aims to fuse Ethereum’s security, Solana’s high performance, and Celestia’s modular data availability architecture. Celestia plays a vital role by offering scalable and cost-efficient data storage, which allows Eclipse to reduce costs and enhance scalability.  \n\nIn September 2024, Eclipse announced plans to launch its mainnet in October, with CEO Vijay Cetti emphasizing that the integration with Celestia is key to lowering storage costs and boosting security, aiming for a target of 10,000 TPS.  \n\nIn November 2024, the protocol Stride revealed the opening of a cross-chain bridge between Celestia and Eclipse, allowing users to transfer TIA tokens from Celestia to Eclipse. This development strengthened the collaboration between the two projects and expanded their ecosystem capabilities.  \n\nThe partnership between Celestia and Eclipse exemplifies the synergy achievable through modular blockchain technologies, set to enhance performance, scalability, and data availability across the Ethereum ecosystem."
