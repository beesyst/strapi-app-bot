  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nEclipse is an innovative Layer 2 solution built on Ethereum, utilizing the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to significantly boost transaction speed and scalability across the network. Founded in 2022 in the United States, the project quickly gained traction. In March 2024, Eclipse raised $50 million in a Series A funding round, valuing the company at a billion dollars. The mainnet was launched in November 2024, marking a key milestone that catalyzed the growth of its ecosystem. By July 2025, Eclipse had processed over 22.1 billion transactions and attracted more than 1.1 million unique wallets. In the same month, the native token $ES was introduced, serving as both a gas token and a decentralized governance instrument.\n\n## Functionality\n\nEclipse harmonizes the strengths of Ethereum and Solana, ensuring both high performance and security. Its architecture comprises several core components:\n\n- **Ethereum Settlement Layer**: Utilizes Ethereum’s security guarantees for transaction finality, ensuring trustless confirmation.  \n- **SVM Execution Layer**: The Solana Virtual Machine enables parallel processing of transactions, dramatically increasing throughput compared to single-threaded systems like EVM.  \n- **Data Availability via Celestia**: Incorporates Celestia to efficiently store transaction data, reducing costs and supporting large transaction volumes.  \n- **Fraud Proofs with RISC Zero**: Deploys zero-knowledge proofs through RISC Zero to detect and prove invalid transactions without rerunning them on-chain, enhancing security and trustworthiness.\n\nThis modular architecture allows Eclipse to achieve high transaction speeds, low fees, and excellent scalability while maintaining Ethereum’s core security and decentralization principles.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) Integration**: Enables parallel processing for high throughput.\n- **Ethereum Settlement Layer**: Provides secure transaction finality using Ethereum as the base layer.\n- **Data Availability via Celestia**: Lowers storage costs and enhances scaling capacity.\n- **Fraud Proofs with RISC Zero**: Ensures network integrity through zero-knowledge proofs.\n- **$ES Token**: Acts as a gas token and a decentralized governance tool.\n- **High Transaction Throughput**: Capable of processing billions of transactions for extensive scalability.\n- **Low Transaction Fees**: Maintains minimal costs thanks to an efficient architecture.\n- **Developer-Friendly Environment**: Supports high-performance dApp development.\n- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Facilitates integration with various blockchain networks.\n- **Robust Ecosystem Growth**: Continually attracting dApps and users, expanding its ecosystem.\n\n## Celestia x Eclipse\n\nCelestia and Eclipse collaborate closely within the modular blockchain landscape, combining their respective strengths to enhance scalability and efficiency for decentralized applications. As the pioneering Layer 2 solution on Ethereum that leverages the Solana Virtual Machine for executing transactions, Eclipse integrates Celestia as its data availability layer. This integration dramatically improves throughput and reduces data storage costs while preserving security and decentralization through Ethereum’s robust consensus layer.\n\nIn September 2024, Eclipse announced plans to launch its mainnet by October, emphasizing that the Celestia integration aims to cut storage costs and bolster security in pursuit of their target of 10,000 transactions per second. By November 2024, the Stride protocol established a cross-chain bridge between Celestia and Eclipse, enabling users to transfer TIA tokens from Celestia into Eclipse and allowing seamless interoperability.  \n\nThis partnership reflects a shared vision to develop high-performance, scalable blockchain solutions by combining Celestia’s modular architecture with Eclipse’s innovative SVM approach, paving the way for a more efficient decentralized future."
