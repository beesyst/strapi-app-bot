  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nEclipse stands as a next-generation scalable blockchain platform designed to combine Solana’s high performance with Ethereum’s security. Built around the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which is deployed as a rollup solution on Ethereum, Eclipse aims to offer a highly efficient Layer 2 ecosystem. The project was launched in September 2022 after successfully raising $15 million in a seed round, following an earlier $6 million investment from Polychain Capital and partners. On November 7, 2024, Eclipse launched its mainnet, becoming the world’s first Ethereum L2 based on SVM. Throughout its development, Eclipse has been actively collaborating with industry leaders including Celestia, EigenLayer, Oasis Labs, Polygon, Cosmos, and NEAR, forging a robust ecosystem. In March 2024, the project raised an additional $50 million in Series A funding at a valuation of $1 billion, led by Hack VC and Polychain Capital, with participation from Bankless Ventures, Delphi Digital, and others. Its leadership team includes CEO Vijay Chetty, formerly of Uniswap, dYdX, Ripple, and BlackRock, and CTO Ben Livshitz, with backgrounds at zkSync, Brave, Microsoft Research, and Imperial College London. In July 2025, the ES token was listed on Phemex.\n\nEclipse operates as a modular Layer 2 solution tailored for Ethereum, leveraging the SVM to enable parallel transaction execution across multiple cores, which significantly boosts throughput compared to traditional Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) environments. Instead of storing data within Ethereum, Eclipse utilizes Celestia for data availability, reducing network load and transaction costs. Its rollup mechanism periodically reconciles state and transaction snapshots with Ethereum for security and finality. The platform supports the deployment of decentralized applications (DApps) from both the Ethereum and Solana ecosystems, providing users with immediate access to DeFi protocols, GameFi, and other services through integrations like Orca’s automated market maker and Save’s lending protocols.\n\n## Functionality\n\nEclipse functions as a modular Layer 2 overlay on Ethereum, powered by the Solana Virtual Machine which supports parallel transaction processing across multiple cores for maximum throughput. It employs a data availability layer provided by Celestia, separating computation, consensus, and data storage to optimize scalability and decentralization. Transactions executed on SVM are periodically submitted to Ethereum for settlement, with security guarantees derived from Ethereum’s mainnet finality. Support for Solana-compatible smart contracts written mainly in Rust enables DApps from Solana to operate seamlessly on Eclipse, enhancing interoperability. Eclipse’s protocol architecture includes decentralized finance (DeFi) modules, automated market makers like Orca, and credit protocols such as Save, offering a comprehensive ecosystem for developers and users alike.\n\n## Features\n\n- **High Scalability**: Processes tens of thousands of transactions per second through SVM's multi-threaded parallel execution\n- **Ethereum Settlement**: Secures all data and finality guarantees via Ethereum’s base layer\n- **Solana VM Support**: Allows Solana DApps and programs, mainly written in Rust, to run on Eclipse with minimal modifications\n- **Celestia Data Availability**: Integrates Celestia for scalable, trust-minimized data storage and validation\n- **DApps Interoperability**: Enables cross-ecosystem deployment and scaling of DApps from Solana and Ethereum\n- **Strong Security**: Ensures transaction finality and settlement via Ethereum’s mainnet security model\n- **ES Token Utility**: Serves as gas token, governance asset, and is used for staking in the network\n- **Robust Ecosystem Support**: Collaborates closely with Celestia, NEAR, Polygon, EigenLayer, Oasis Labs, Cosmos and others\n- **Top-Tier Investors**: Funding exceeds $65 million with a valuation of $1 billion, backed by Hack VC, Polychain Capital, Tribe Capital, Placeholder, Delphi Digital\n- **Industry-Leading Team**: Leadership and R&D include veterans from Uniswap, dYdX, BlackRock, Ripple, zkSync, Brave, Microsoft Research, and Imperial College London\n- **Launchpad for DeFi and Consumer Apps**: Over 60 DApps launched, covering DeFi, GameFi, and infrastructure solutions\n- **Rust and Language Support**: Core programming in Rust with potential future support for Move\n- **Parallel Processing**: SVM offers high throughput via multi-core parallel transaction execution\n- **Mainnet Launched on Nov 7, 2024**: Official mainnet deployment with diverse DApps and services\n- **TGE and Listing on July 16, 2025**: ES token listed on Phemex for spot trading\n\n## Celestia x Eclipse\n\nThe collaboration between Eclipse and Celestia forms a critical pillar of Eclipse’s architecture. From late 2023 onward, Eclipse integrated Celestia as its primary Data Availability (DA) layer for its Ethereum-based Layer 2 solutions built on SVM. This partnership is officially confirmed by both parties and distinguishes Eclipse as one of the key clients leveraging Celestia’s DA infrastructure to scale data availability for rollups.\n\nEclipse is designed as a modular blockchain solution where execution happens via SVM and security is anchored on Ethereum, with data availability managed by Celestia. Unlike many other Ethereum Layer 2 solutions that rely either on calldata stored within Ethereum or on proprietary DA schemes with limited decentralization, Eclipse’s architecture explicitly uses Celestia for storing rollup data, ensuring scalable, trust-minimized data access. Publicly, Celestia Labs confirms Eclipse as a major client utilizing Celestia’s DA Layer, emphasizing its role in supporting high-performance, scalable modular chains.\n\nThe official mainnet of Eclipse, incorporating Celestia’s DA, was launched in December 2023. Blocks stored on Celestia initially had a size of 2MB, with plans to increase up to 8MB as the light Data Availability Service nodes expanded—crucial for supporting large-scale Layer 2 rollups. This deployment was extensively covered in technical discussions and media at the time, establishing Eclipse’s architecture as a prominent example of modular blockchain design.\n\nSupporting documents, public guides, and ecosystem discussions continuously reaffirm the active partnership with Celestia, with no signs of deviation or delay in their joint roadmap as of mid-2025."
