  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nEclipse is a cutting-edge, modular Layer 2 rollup network, designed to scale the Ethereum ecosystem by offering broad compatibility, flexible component selection, and high throughput. Founded in February 2023 by Nihal Krishan, formerly of Solana Labs, and Ketan Shah, a former Coinbase engineer, Eclipse Labs entered the scene with a vision for next-generation modular architecture. In May 2023, Eclipse kicked off active development after securing $15 million in seed funding, with investments led by Polychain Capital and Tribe Capital and participation from Delphi Digital and other institutional backers. The company launched its first public Ethereum testnet in March 2024, followed by the official Alpha mainnet release for a select alliance of developers on May 16, 2024.\n\nDistinct from traditional L2 solutions, Eclipse’s hybrid design allows for each component—data availability (DA), consensus, and execution—to be configured independently. The current implementation leverages Celestia as the primary data availability layer, employs the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) for execution, and anchors transaction verification and finality into Ethereum. Eclipse’s development strategy hinges on building deep integrations, highlighted by its partnership with Omni Network, announced on May 21, 2024, to facilitate cross-chain communications and accelerate modular blockchain construction. The project’s 2024 roadmap includes launching a permissionless network, issuing a native token, and expanding the ecosystem further.\n\n## Functionality\n\nEclipse’s technological architecture is defined by its modular approach: by decoupling the consensus, execution, and data storage layers, developers can create custom rollup chains tailored for their desired performance, cost, and trust parameters. Presently, the network utilizes Celestia for low-cost data storage—reducing publication expenses—while the VM layer is powered by SVM, chosen for its high throughput and robust codebase. Block finality is secured via Ethereum, where transaction anchors provide proof of correctness and secure access to ETH-native assets through standard bridges.\n\nExecution Nodes accept, sort, and process user transactions within the SVM environment, while Sequencers publish state roots and execution data to both Celestia and Ethereum at specified checkpoints. Each modular layer—DA, Execution, Settlement—is ultimately interchangeable: Eclipse continues to develop support for alternative execution environments, such as EVM, and is exploring additional data availability providers for the future. Smart contracts are written in Rust (via Anchor/Sealevel), streamlining porting of Solana programs. Users enjoy a familiar UX typical of high-performance networks: low fees, instant confirmations, and no mainnet delays. Since April 2024, the majority of Eclipse’s SDKs and documentation have been open-sourced on GitHub, including tooling to interact with Solana-style programs and integrate with leading Ethereum wallets. Altogether, Eclipse positions itself as a versatile, modular L2 solution for the Ethereum community, combining scalability, programmability, and direct-bridge interoperability.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Modularity**: Allows developers to mix and match different data availability, execution, and settlement layers as desired.\n- **Solana VM Integration**: Utilizes Solana Virtual Machine for execution, enabling high throughput and compatibility with Solana programs.\n- **Celestia Data Availability**: Employs Celestia as the primary DA layer, reducing storage costs and accelerating transaction publishing.\n- **Ethereum Anchoring**: Regularly anchors rollup state to Ethereum, boosting security and user trust.\n- **Rust (Anchor) Smart Contracts**: Supports smart contract development in Rust via Anchor, facilitating seamless migration of Solana programs.\n- **Alpha Mainnet Live**: Alpha mainnet launched on May 16, 2024, for early partners and approved developers.\n- **$15M Seed Funding**: Raised $15 million in May 2023 from Polychain Capital and other leading investors.\n- **Active Integrations**: Partnership with Omni Network for cross-chain communication and an enhanced modular stack.\n- **Open-source SDK**: Tools, libraries, and documentation are open-source and available on GitHub.\n- **Ecosystem Roadmap**: Plans include EVM integration, launching a permissionless mainnet, and releasing a native token in 2024.\n\n## Celestia x Eclipse\n\nCelestia and Eclipse have emerged as landmark projects in the modular blockchain ecosystem, with a comprehensive, well-documented partnership encompassing technical integrations, strategic collaboration, and public statements from both teams. At its core, Eclipse relies on Celestia as the data availability layer powering its rollup infrastructure, a relationship continually highlighted since early 2023.\n\nEclipse originally began as an \"Ethereum rollup on Solana,\" but quickly pivoted to a fully modular architecture. On January 17, 2023, Eclipse formally announced integration with Celestia. In a blog post by Eclipse CEO Nihal Sharma, published on the Celestia website, it was stated explicitly: \"Eclipse integrates Celestia as its data availability layer.\" This partnership meant that transactional data processed by Eclipse rollups would be stored in Celestia’s purpose-built, decentralized environment.\n\nThe announcement further emphasized that while Eclipse’s execution layer was based on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), its modular design allowed easy substitution of execution, data storage, and verification engines. This flexibility was a primary reason for choosing Celestia, making Eclipse the first in the industry to implement a truly independent DA layer, decoupled from Ethereum or other Layer 1s. Such architecture dramatically reduces operational costs and improves throughput.\n\nCelestia’s importance to Eclipse’s roadmap was made even clearer in March 2023, when Eclipse named Celestia as a key strategic partner and technical provider in its seed round announcement. Celestia Labs was also listed as a major investor alongside Galaxy, a fact celebrated in social channels such as Celestia’s March 9, 2023, Twitter update, which underscored the collaborative significance.\n\nOn March 23, 2023, Eclipse CEO Nikhil Sharma spoke at the Modular Summit 2023 (Celestia’s flagship event), elaborating on Eclipse’s architecture and the technical reasons for selecting Celestia as the foundational DA layer—further evidence of a deep technical and business partnership.\n\nContinuing the collaboration, on October 12, 2023, Eclipse announced the launch of the Eclipse Mainnet Alpha, repeatedly underscoring its reliance on Celestia (alongside Ethereum) for data recording. The rollout’s first deployment showcased Celestia as the DA of choice, signaling a successful real-world integration.\n\nCelestia has also consistently referenced its relationship with Eclipse in official rollup ecosystem lists—for example, including Eclipse as a leading integration in its May 2023 rollup ecosystem overview.\n\nAfter Celestia’s own mainnet and TIA token launched in late October 2023, Eclipse was among the first to announce live rollup integrations using Celestia and published comprehensive guides detailing the process of deploying rollups on Celestia in conjunction with Eclipse."
