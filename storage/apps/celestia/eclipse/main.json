  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nEclipse is a high-performance second-layer (Layer 2) solution built on Ethereum, aiming to combine the network's security and liquidity with the parallel transaction processing capabilities of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Launched officially in the mainnet on July 30, 2024, the project was founded in 2022 and has since attracted substantial investments—raising $65 million across multiple funding rounds, including a $50 million Series A in March 2024 that valued the company at $200 million.\n\n## Functionality\n\nEclipse operates on a modular architecture that separates execution, data availability, and transaction finality into distinct components. It leverages Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) for transaction execution, offering parallel processing and high throughput. Transaction data is published on Celestia, which reduces costs and enhances scalability. For transaction finality and validation, Eclipse employs RISC Zero, a zero-knowledge proof system that assures integrity without requiring re-execution on the main chain.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Modular Architecture**: Allows developers to configure execution, data availability, and finality layers according to their specific needs.\n- **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes SVM to handle multiple transactions concurrently, significantly boosting throughput.\n- **Low Fees**: Data publication to Celestia keeps costs minimal, making high-volume applications feasible.\n- **High Security**: Relies on Ethereum's robust security model for transaction finality.\n- **Ethereum Compatibility**: Supports existing Ethereum tools, wallets, and smart contracts, facilitating smooth migration.\n- **DeFi and Gaming Support**: Provides the infrastructure necessary for high-performance decentralized finance and gaming dApps.\n- **RISC Zero Integration**: Uses zk-proofs to validate transactions efficiently without reprocessing them on the main chain.\n- **Multi-Virtual Machine Support**: Compatible with both EVM and SVM, broadening development possibilities.\n- **Celestia Integration**: Leverages Celestia for scalable, cost-effective data availability.\n- **Developer Flexibility**: Empowers developers to craft tailored solutions aligned with their project requirements.\n\n## Celestia x Eclipse\n\nThe Eclipse project, initiated by Neil Somani in 2022, is designed as a second-layer solution integrating Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to execute transactions. Its primary goal is to fuse Solana’s high throughput with Ethereum’s liquidity and security, all within a modular blockchain framework. Central to this architecture is Celestia, which supplies data availability (DA) services to support the network.\n\nCelestia is a modular blockchain network focused on data availability. By decoupling transaction execution from data storage, Celestia enables different blockchain solutions to scale more efficiently and flexibly, unlocking new possibilities for Layer 2 implementations.\n\nIn September 2024, Eclipse announced plans to launch its mainnet in October. The CEO of Eclipse Labs, Vidhaj Chetti, revealed at Solana Breakpoint in Singapore on September 20, 2024, that the network was already in a stage accessible to developers and validators, though it did not yet feature a user interface. Chetti emphasized that integrating Celestia addresses many Layer 2 blockchains’ data storage issues—specifically, the high costs associated with storing large amounts of data off-chain. Eclipse will publish transaction data as blobs to Celestia, ensuring transparency and verifiability.\n\nIn October 2024, Eclipse secured key funding of $50 million to accelerate the development of its Layer 2 solution ahead of the mainnet launch. Founder Neil Somani pointed out that despite updates like Dencun and EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding), the team plans to utilize Celestia for data availability. This setup allows Eclipse to publish transaction blobs on Celestia efficiently, enabling better transparency and data verification.\n\nThe collaboration between Celestia and Eclipse centers on embedding Celestia’s Data Availability layer into Eclipse’s architecture. This integration enhances Eclipse’s capabilities by combining the high performance of Solana’s VM with Ethereum’s security, while Celestia provides a scalable, reliable data storage solution—together creating a flexible, efficient, and secure Layer 2 ecosystem."
