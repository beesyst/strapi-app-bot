  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nEclipse is an innovative Layer 2 protocol that launched officially on November 7, 2024. It uniquely combines the raw computing power and architecture of Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) with the security, liquidity, and ecosystem of Ethereum. This makes it the first fully functional SVM-based L2 solution on Ethereum. The project was founded by leading figures in the crypto space: Vijay Chetty, former CEO of Uniswap, dYdX, BlackRock, and Ripple, serves as CEO, while Ben Livshits, formerly of Imperial College London, Brave, and zkSync, is CTO. The infrastructure and development are managed by the Eclipse Foundation and Eclipse Labs. \n\nSince its inception, Eclipse has quickly gained traction — in November 2024, the network launched with 60 integrated dApps spanning DeFi, gaming, and consumer applications, including early adopters like Orca and Save. On March 11, 2024, the project closed a Series A funding round, raising $50 million under the management of Placeholder and Hack VC, bringing total funding to $65 million, supported by prominent investors such as Polychain, Bankless Ventures, Delphi Digital, and strategic partners related to Solana.\n\nIn July 2025, Eclipse released its native multi-chain token, $ES, with contract addresses published on Ethereum, Solana, and the Eclipse Mainnet. The token became active at 10:00 UTC on July 16, 2025. $ES is now listed on exchanges like Phemex and KuCoin — the spot trading pair ES/USDT was added on July 16, 2025.\n\n## Functionality\n\nEclipse is built as an optimistic rollup Layer 2 solution that verifies transactions on Ethereum, providing decentralization and resistance to censorship through a validating bridge and data publication protocol. The core execution environment is based on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), allowing high parallelism, scalability, and development using Rust. To ensure data availability, Eclipse integrates with Celestia, which enables the network to handle load comparable to top-tier SVM networks, providing transparent data access and verifiable blocks for all validation layers. Ethereum acts as the settlement layer, anchoring the security and finality of transactions.\n\nA distinguishing feature of Eclipse is its innovative architecture: it employs SmartNICs, FPGAs, and GPUs for low-latency transaction processing, complemented by a dynamic caching mechanism that creates isolated \"hotspot islands\" for load balancing and MEV extraction. The platform aims to build a \"GigaScale Virtual Machine\" (GSVM), envisioned as the next leap in blockchain computing, enabling applications to operate at speeds comparable to specialized data centers while remaining fully decentralized.\n\nEclipse offers users and developers an integrated ecosystem: immediate compatibility with Solana applications (via SVM), access to Ethereum’s liquidity and assets, robust security guarantees through aggregated rollup tech, and seamless interoperability with leading networks and dApps across both ecosystems. The ecosystem’s native token, $ES, will facilitate gas payments, protocol governance, operator incentives for sequencers, and\n\n## Features\n\n- **SVM-Based Execution**: Business logic and smart contracts execute on Solana Virtual Machine, supporting multi-threading and parallel transaction processing.\n- **Ethereum Settlement**: Rollup transactions are aggregated and settled on Ethereum for maximum security and liquidity.\n- **Celestia Data Availability**: Utilizes Celestia to ensure high data availability and transparency at minimal costs.\n- **GigaScale Virtual Machine (GSVM)**: Next-generation compute client with hardware acceleration using SmartNICs, FPGAs, and GPUs.\n- **Multi-Network Token $ES**: Token operates across Ethereum, Eclipse Mainnet, and Solana, used for governance, gas fees, and staking validators.\n- **Initial dApps Integration**: Over 60 dApps from DeFi, gaming, and Web3 sectors, including Solana’s Orca and Save.\n- **High-Performance Parallelism**: Platform optimized for multi-threaded, low-latency processing, with dynamic resource allocation.\n- **Optimistic Rollup Architecture**: Uses an optimistic model with dispute windows, where validity is proven ex post, incentivized through economic penalties.\n- **Top-Tier Backers and Funding**: Backed by prominent investors like Placeholder, Hack VC, Polychain, Delphi Digital, and core team founders of Solana, with a total raised amount of $65 million.\n- **Cross-Ecosystem Interoperability**: Supports launching SVM applications with direct access to assets and users from both Ethereum and Solana.\n- **Native MEV Capture**: Implements local fee markets and supports direct MEV extraction for DApps.\n- **Active Governance**: Managed via $ES token staking, encouraging participant incentives for network validators and operators.\n- **Open Source Development**: The codebase, deposit bridges, and testing tools are publicly available on GitHub.\n- **Rapid Exchange Listing**: Token $ES listed on Phemex (16 July 2025) and KuCoin (15 July 2025).\n- **EVM support via Neon**: Compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts through Neon EVM for backward compatibility.\n\n## Celestia x Eclipse\n\nThe relationship between Celestia and Eclipse is deeply integrated and symbiotic, forming a significant part of the next wave of modular blockchain ecosystems. Eclipse positions itself as a Layer 2 solution that leverages three blockchain technologies: Solana’s high-speed execution (via SVM), Ethereum’s security and liquidity, and Celestia’s data availability layer.\n\nSince early 2025, public statements have highlighted Eclipse’s use of Celestia’s data availability layer to facilitate efficient, low-cost block publishing. All transaction data generated within Eclipse is batched and published to Celestia, which provides the backbone for high throughput and rapid confirmation times. This process involves \"Blobstream,\" a mechanism that submits signed attestations from Celestia validators to Ethereum smart contracts, attesting that data has been correctly published. The system can verify and dispute data integrity, ensuring security across layers.\n\nThe collaboration dates back to at least September 2022, when Coindesk announced Eclipse's strategic partnership with Celestia. Over 2023 and into early 2024, the integration deepened, with technical whitepapers explaining data transmission mechanics and extensive educational resources published. By late 2024, the Eclipse mainnet was fully live, with a healthy ecosystem heavily relying on Celestia’s data layer.\n\nToday, the architecture’s scalability and robustness depend critically on Celestia’s data availability layer — without it, the modular design would face significant limitations. The ongoing partnership is reinforced through joint events, developer collaborations, and shared technical outputs, underscoring the integral role Celestia plays in enabling Eclipse’s innovative mission of scalable, secure, and interoperable blockchain infrastructure."
