  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nAltLayer is an open, decentralized protocol for deploying native and restaked rollups, with support for both optimistic and zk stacks, as described in the project’s official documentation. The platform combines Rollups-as-a-Service, a no-code constructor for rollups, with a set of modular AVS (Actively Validated Services) that provide state verification, accelerated finality, and decentralized block sequencing. AltLayer has attracted strategic funding and developed ecosystem integrations, including a $14.4 million round closed in September 2023, as reported in a press release and industry press. The project launched its native ALT token and conducted Season 1 airdrop, issuing 300 million ALT (3% of the total supply); this initial distribution phase was widely covered in early 2024. The team regularly publishes technical updates and roadmaps in its blog and documentation.\n\n## Functionality\n\nArchitecturally, AltLayer implements restaked rollups through three core AVS components: VITAL for decentralized verification, MACH for accelerated finality, and SQUAD for decentralized sequencing. These AVS form a vertically integrated subsystem for every deployed rollup. Restaked rollups on AltLayer integrate with restaking mechanisms such as EigenLayer to provide security margins and economic incentives for validators, as described in the product documentation. The platform supports a broad range of rollup stacks, including OP Stack, Arbitrum Orbit, ZKStack/zkEVM, and Polygon CDK, and can operate atop various data availability solutions such as Celestia, EigenDA, and Avail. It also provides an in-house stack with modular components, with all configurations and capabilities documented in the official documentation. The product lineup includes a Rollups-as-a-Service launcher for rapid deployment, advertised as capable of spinning up a basic rollup in about two minutes for simple configurations, and AVS-as-a-Service, publicly announced on September 5, 2024, with a public representation of the AVS platform and a series of production AVS releases by the end of 2024.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Restaked Rollups**: A composition of three AVS components (VITAL, MACH, SQUAD) enabling decentralized state verification, accelerated finality, and decentralized sequencing, with integration to EigenLayer for economic security.\n- **Rollups-as-a-Service (RaaS) Launchpad**: A no-code constructor that enables creating a custom rollup with EVM/WASM factories and ready-made stack templates, targeting a basic spin-up time of about two minutes.\n- **AVS-as-a-Service (Wizard)**: A platform for rapid generation and management of AVS, publicly announced as the AVS accelerator, enabling faster adoption of the AVS model.\n- **Tiered Finality (MACH / VITAL)**: A multi-tier finality approach—Tier-1, Tier-2, Tier-3 alongside MACH—to balance speed and security for applications.\n- **Decentralized Sequencers (SQUAD)**: A distributed sequencing model to reduce single points of failure and vendor lock-in for RaaS providers.\n- **Multi-stack and DA‑compatibility**: Support for OP Stack, Arbitrum Orbit, ZKStack, Polygon CDK and other stacks, plus data availability solutions such as Celestia, EigenDA, and Avail.\n- **Ecosystem Integrations**: Public partnerships and integrations, including cross-chain interoperability efforts and collaboration with EigenLayer on restaking and AVS integration.\n- **Go-to-market and Ecosystem**: Public AVS releases and deployment milestones, including GoPlus AVS mainnet and BLITZ for fast finality on Arbitrum Orbit, with Eigen grant funding of 1 million EIGEN.\n- **Tokenomics and Airdrop**: Season-1 airdrop of 300 million ALT (3% of total supply), with details and timelines covered in industry reporting and official announcements in early 2024.\n\n## Monad x Altlayer\n\nThe official roadmap section of AltLayer’s documentation indicates a planned milestone in Q3 2025 to support Monad and MegaETH, with the entry last updated roughly nine to ten months ago. AltLayer published material describing Monad founder Keone’s appearance at Rollup Day Bangkok in December 2024, noting participation but not implying a technical integration or joint product. Monad released a public testnet onboarding guide on February 19, 2025, confirming the testnet’s public availability ahead of the Q3 2025 milestone referenced in the roadmap. From the cited official sources, the documented connections between the projects are limited to the roadmap entry and the Bangkok appearance; there are no press releases or technical posts confirming completed integrations, joint releases, or deployed products between AltLayer and Monad.",
