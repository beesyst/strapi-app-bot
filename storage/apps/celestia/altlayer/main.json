  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nAltLayer is an open, decentralized protocol and product suite for launching rollups as a service, supporting both optimistic and zk rollups and offering RaaS, Verifiable AIaaS, and AVSaaS solutions. It provides a unified platform to deploy, secure, and manage rollups at scale. The core concept is restaked rollups, using EigenLayer restaking to deliver economic security and decentralized state validation, along with actively validated services for verification, fast finality, and decentralized sequencing.\n\nAltLayer’s architecture centers on the idea of restaked rollups and AVS, leveraging EigenLayer to enhance security and decentralization while enabling verifiable services for various rollup ecosystems. The project aims to pair AVS with external data availability and settlement layers to support multiple rollup stacks and data feeds efficiently. The approach emphasizes verifiability, modularity, and composability across different execution environments.\n\nAltLayer completed a seed round announced on July 1, 2022, raising $7.2 million with investors including Polychain Capital, Jump Crypto, and Breyer Capital. A strategic fundraising round of $14.4 million was announced on February 19, 2024, with participation from Polychain and Hack VC alongside other industry funds. The project issued the native ALT token and launched on Binance Launchpool with listing on January 25, 2024, while the first airdrop of 300 million ALT (3% of the total supply) became claimable after the snapshot on January 17, 2024.\n\n## Functionality\n\nAltLayer’s architecture rests on a modular AVS core—VITAL for decentralized state verification, MACH for rapid finality, and SQUAD for decentralized sequencing—delivering verifiable services for any rollup stack. These components are designed to operate together to provide end-to-end verifiability and security across deployments. The platform emphasizes composability with other layers and tools to enable robust rollup operations.\n\nThe AVS modules are designed to integrate with EigenLayer restaking and external data availability and settlement layers, including Celestia and Avail, while supporting a variety of rollup stacks such as OP Stack, Arbitrum Orbit, ZKStack, Polygon CDK, and more. This multi-layer compatibility enables diverse execution environments to benefit from verifiable services and secure sequencing. The architecture supports seamless interaction with bridges and external oracles to enable cross-rollup interoperability.\n\nThe product lineup includes a no-code RaaS Launchpad that enables deploying custom rollups (persistent or ephemeral) in minutes, with end-of-life settlement on L1, and tools to manage AVS operators and reward/slash policies. The platform provides an operational framework for running active validators, governance, and service-level controls. Network principles include tiered finality, fraud proofs for optimistic modes, decentralized sequencers, and support for multi-VM/TEE environments to enable verifiable AI and other specialized tasks.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Restaked Rollups (VITAL/MACH/SQUAD)**: AVS for decentralized state verification, accelerated finality, and decentralized sequencing, integrated with EigenLayer.\n- **Rollup‑as‑a‑Service (RaaS) Launchpad**: No‑code interface for deploying customizable persistent and ephemeral rollups via factories and templates.\n- **Multi‑stack Support**: Compatibility with OP Stack, Arbitrum Orbit, Polygon CDK, ZKStack, and other rollup stacks to support varied execution environments.\n- **DA & Settlement Flexibility**: Ability to choose different data availability and settlement layers, including Celestia and Avail, for a given rollup.\n- **Tiered Finality**: An architecture that accelerates transaction confirmations while preserving economic security.\n- **Decentralized Sequencers**: A SQUAD-based model to distribute sequencing and reduce single points of failure.\n- **Fraud Proofs & Optimistic Security**: Support for fraud-proof mechanisms for optimistic rollups and verifiable on‑chain calculations.\n- **Verifiable AI (TEE) Support**: Platform for running verifiable AI agents in trusted execution environments with execution proofs.\n- **Token Economics & Community Drops**: Native ALT token with a total supply of 10 billion, Binance Launchpool launch, and an initial airdrop of 300 million ALT distributed after the January 17, 2024 snapshot.\n- **VC & Strategic Backing**: Early investors and strategic rounds include Polychain, Jump Crypto, Breyer Capital, Hack VC, OKX Ventures, and others; seed round closed on July 1, 2022 for $7.2M and strategic round announced on February 19, 2024 for $14.4M.\n\n## Monad x Altlayer\n\nThe official roadmap page for AltLayer explicitly shows Q3 2025 as the timeframe for supporting Monad and MegaETH, indicating publicly announced plans to extend compatibility to Monad in that period. Monad has published guidance titled the Monad Testnet Onboarding Guide dated 2025-02-19, describing the testnet launch and developer tooling; the cross‑chain guidance lists providers such as Chainlink CCIP, Garden, Hyperlane, LayerZero, Polymer, Wormhole, and others, with AltLayer not listed at the time of the guide’s publication. Public updates from AltLayer demonstrate ongoing activity in 2024–2025, including a June 26, 2025 post noting support for Gattaca-based rollup stacks, signaling continued official communication about the roadmap and integrations.",
