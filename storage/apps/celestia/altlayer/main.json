  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nAltLayer is an open, decentralized protocol and Rollup‑as‑a‑Service (RaaS) that provides tooling for rapid deployment of both ephemeral and persistent application‑specific rollups, with support for optimistic and zk stacks. The platform introduces the concept of restaked rollups, where protection, verification, and accelerated finality are supplied by a trio of Actively Validated Services (AVSes) — VITAL, MACH, and SQUAD — along with integrations with EigenLayer and external data‑availability (DA) solutions. AltLayer markets itself as a multi‑stack solution, claiming compatibility with OP Stack, Arbitrum Orbit, Polygon CDK, ZKStack, and a range of DA layers such as Celestia, EigenDA, Avail, and others.\n\nThe AltLayer project was announced in June 2022, with cofounder and leader Yaoqi (Jia) identified as the initiative’s driver. The native ALT token launched in January 2024, accompanied by a Binance Launchpool program and a Binance listing on January 25, 2024. Binance publicly published the launch details on January 17, 2024, describing farming from January 19–24, the listing date, and a maximum supply of 10 billion ALT. AltLayer also announced a grant of 1,000,000 EIGEN from Eigen Foundation, with plans to distribute the grant to the community; these announcements appeared on the official site and associated channels.\n\n## Functionality\n\nAt the core, AltLayer’s functionality rests on three AVS modules: VITAL provides decentralized verification of rollup state correctness, MACH delivers accelerated finality of transactions, and SQUAD implements decentralized sequencing of transactions. Collectively, these components enable any supported rollup stack to operate as a restaked rollup secured by EigenLayer’s economic guarantees. The documentation explains each AVS as a standalone unit and details how they combine to ensure state verification, finality, and a distributed transaction queue.\n\nThe RaaS offering includes a no‑code Rollup Launchpad and a developer SDK. AltLayer claims developers can deploy a customizable rollup in roughly two minutes via a dashboard, with support for both EVM and WASM execution environments and the option to select the DA/stack at deployment. The platform also supports ALT staking and a restaking workflow via the reALT mechanism, with a staking portal and documented parameters, including a 21‑day unbonding period.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Restaked Rollups (VITAL / MACH / SQUAD)**: A trio of AVS provides decentralized verification of state, fast finality, and decentralized sequencing to enable restaked security for rollups via EigenLayer.\n- **Rollup‑as‑a‑Service (RaaS) Launchpad**: No‑code dashboard and developer SDK for deploying ephemeral and persistent rollups with configurable execution environments and DA, in about two minutes.\n- **Multi‑stack Support**: Compatibility with OP Stack, Arbitrum Orbit, ZKStack, Polygon CDK, Starkware, and integration with various DA solutions such as Celestia, EigenDA, and Avail.\n- **Tiered Finality / MACH Fast Finality**: MACH provides crypto‑economically backed fast finality to reduce latency and improve cross‑system interaction.\n- **Decentralized Sequencing (Beacon / SQUAD)**: A decentralized set of sequencers eliminates a single point of failure in sequencing.\n- **ALT Tokenomics & Launch**: Maximum supply of 10,000,000,000 ALT; Launchpool activities in late January 2024 and subsequent listing on Binance with allocation for the Launchpool.\n- **Airdrop Season One**: Initial airdrop of 300,000,000 ALT (3% of max supply) with a claim window from late January to late February 2024 and a photographered Ethereum snapshot.\n- **Staking / Restake (reALT)**: ALT staking portal and the ability to convert stALT to reALT, with documented minimums, fees, and a 21‑day unbonding period.\n- **Open‑source Repositories (Alt Research / GitHub)**: Core components and SDKs are available in the Alt Research GitHub organization, detailing foundational stack blocks and developer tools.\n- **Roadmap / AVS‑Wizard & Blitz**: Public roadmap and implementation status outline integration milestones, MACH/VITAL testnets, planned mainnet restaked rollups, and future AVS Wizard and Blitz developments.\n- **Partnerships and Clients**: A range of integrations and client use cases have been documented, including Cyber L2, Xterio, Injective, Swell, MyShell, and B² Network.\n\n## Monad x Altlayer\n\nThe official project roadmap explicitly states “Q3 2025: Support Monad,” reflecting AltLayer’s intention to add Monad compatibility in the third quarter of 2025. This entry is documented in the Roadmap section of AltLayer’s documentation. Monad’s representatives have participated in Rollup Day events hosted by AltLayer; Keone Hon, Monad’s cofounder and CEO, was listed as a speaker, and AltLayer published a recap noting his discussion of Monad’s journey and plans. The Rollup Day materials also include Keone among the confirmed speakers.\n\nMonad publicly published a “Testnet Onboarding Guide” on February 19, 2025, detailing the public testnet timeline and onboarding steps. Public materials from Monad indicate the sequence from Devnet to Private testnet to Public testnet, with the stated testnet release date of February 19, 2025. There is no formal press release from AltLayer or Monad confirming a completed integration or a specific mainnet launch date; the cited sources establish the explicit roadmap intent, event participation, and testnet onboarding guidance as the current public confirmations.",
