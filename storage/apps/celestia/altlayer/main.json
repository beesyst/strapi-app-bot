  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nAltLayer is a decentralized protocol and Rollups-as-a-Service (RaaS) designed to simplify the deployment of custom rollups, including ephemeral and persistent variants, with support for EVM and WASM. It leverages both optimistic and zero-knowledge stack solutions. The platform aims to provide a modular, scalable foundation for tailored rollup capabilities.\n\nDevelopment began in Q4 2021, and by early 2022 the project had a functioning MVP and a devnet. The team officially lists 2021 as the founding year.\n\nAltLayer secured a seed round of 7.2 million dollars, announced on July 1, 2022, with participation from Polychain Capital, Jump Crypto, and Breyer Capital. The project subsequently received strategic investments from Binance Labs, announced on August 9, 2023, and closed a 14.4 million dollar strategic round in September 2023, publicly reported in February 2024. The funds were directed toward scaling the team and expanding rollup infrastructure.\n\n## Functionality\n\nAltLayer builds a restaked rollups architecture in which every deployed solution is supported by a modular set of Active Validated Services AVS for state verification, accelerated finality, and decentralized sequencing, respectively. These components work together to enable secure, efficient operation of customized rollups.\n\nVITAL provides decentralized verification of state roots, with support for bisecting or triggering zero-knowledge proofs when disputes arise. It enables fast withdrawal of funds when sufficient economic guarantees exist.\n\nMACH offers fast finality with three modes of verification: pessimistic, optimistic, and proofs. It serves as an RPC endpoint for consumers that require finality guarantees beyond on-chain checks.\n\nSQUAD operates as a decentralized network of sequencers and validators, where AVS operators can stake collateral and participate in sequencing transactions. AltLayer positions SQUAD as a safeguard against single points of failure in centralized sequencers.\n\nBeyond AVS, AltLayer provides a no-code RaaS launchpad for rollup creation with the ability to deploy a custom rollup ephemerally or persistently, with support for EVM and WASM in minutes. FlashLayer offers burst elasticity for ephemeral rollups, which are created to handle peak load and then settled with the rollup state on L1. Integrations with data availability and restaking ecosystems, including EigenLayer and Celestia, enable flexible security arrangements and cross-chain data accessibility.\n\nALT Token Launch through Binance Launchpool included an announcement in January 2024, with farming from mid to late January and listing shortly after. The token has a maximum supply of ten billion ALT, with a portion allocated to the Launchpool.\n\nAirdrop Season One distributed three hundred million ALT, snapshot in January 2024, with claims opening later that month; early participant addresses were included in the distribution.\n\nFinancing and investments encompass the seed round of seven point two million dollars announced in mid-2022 and a strategic round of fourteen point four million dollars closed in late 2023, with public confirmation in early 2024; Binance Labs announced a strategic investment during 2023.\n\nOpen Source / Repositories: Alt Research maintains public repositories and SDKs on GitHub for developers and researchers.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Restaked Rollups**: Combination of established rollup stacks with a restaking mechanism to deliver scalable, economically secured security.\n- **VITAL (Decentralised Verification)**: AVS service for decentralized verification of new state roots with support for bisecting and ZK proofs in disputed cases.\n- **MACH (Fast Finality)**: AVS service providing three verification modes and a machine-checkable finality endpoint.\n- **SQUAD (Decentralised Sequencing)**: Decentralized network of sequencers and validators where operators stake collateral to manage transaction ordering and inclusion.\n- **RaaS Launchpad (No-code Rollup Creation)**: Web interface and SDK to launch a custom rollup, either ephemeral or persistent, with EVM and WASM support in minutes.\n- **FlashLayer (Ephemeral Rollups)**: Burstâ€‘capable ephemeral execution layers that terminate with the rollup state on L1.\n- **Integrations with DA and Restaking**: Official support for integration with EigenLayer for restaking and with data availability solutions such as Celestia for flexible security and data access.\n- **ALT Token Launch (Binance Launchpool)**: ALT announced on Binance Launchpool with farming and listing details, including supply and allocation.\n- **Airdrop Season One**: Initial ALT airdrop round with specified supply, snapshot date, and eligibility for early participants.\n- **Financing and Investments**: Documented seed and strategic rounds with named investors and timing.\n- **Open Source / Repositories**: Public repositories and SDKs maintained by Alt Research for developers and researchers.\n\n## Monad x Altlayer\n\nAt AltLayer's Rollup Day in Bangkok, Keone, cofounder and leader of Monad, spoke in a Q&A format with Dovey Wan; the recording and summary of this session were published by AltLayer in an Outposts article dated December 5, 2024. A related AltLayer post from late November 2024 mentions Monad's planned mainnet launch in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe official AltLayer roadmap lists a target milestone of Q3 2025 to support Monad and MegaETH, indicating a planned integration timeline. A review of official Monad materials and AltLayer updates shows no confirmed integration or deployment between AltLayer and Monad as of now; Monad's site includes a Monthly Early 2024 Recap, and AltLayer's Updates page lists various releases and partnerships without documenting a completed AltLayer Monad integration."
