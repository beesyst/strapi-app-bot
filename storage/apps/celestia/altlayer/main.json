  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nAltLayer positions itself as a Rollups-as-a-Service platform, enabling the deployment of native and restaked rollup networks across optimistic and ZK stacks. The product description and strategic focus are published on the company’s official site. The platform is designed to streamline the launch and operation of scalable rollup ecosystems.\n\nThe company was founded in 2021, with Singapore listed as one of its corporate addresses. The careers page and the company profile indicate 2021 as the founding year. The information is reflected across the official career materials and business profiles.\n\nAltLayer has conducted multiple funding rounds, including a seed round of $7.2 million in January 2022 and a strategic round of $14.4 million announced in February 2024, led by Polychain Capital and Hack VC. The round is described as closed in September 2023 in some sources, while the February 2024 announcement confirms the strategic close. The company has publicly circulated updates about these rounds on its site and in press coverage.\n\nOn its official blog and updates section, AltLayer documents progressive product releases and partnerships. Milestones highlighted include the ALT token launch on January 17, 2024; AVS and BLITZ releases on November 29, 2024; and a series of integrations with OP Stack, Arbitrum Orbit, Polygon CDK, and EigenLayer. These updates illustrate a trajectory of feature expansion and ecosystem collaboration.\n\n## Functionality\n\nThe core functionality of AltLayer is implemented as an interconnected suite of products. It provides an RaaS panel for rapid deployment of rollup chains with support for multiple stacks and VMs, along with mechanisms to integrate with data availability providers and tooling for execution verification. The platform is designed to simplify cross-stack rollup orchestration and operational control.\n\nThe restaked rollups mechanism relies on integration with EigenLayer to provide security through restaking. The project publishes operational guides and operator registration instructions for AVS in conjunction with EigenLayer. These documents outline how operators can participate in the AVS ecosystem with EigenLayer security.\n\nAltLayer is advancing several application modules. MACH supports restaked rollups with added Arbitrum One support, with a release dated July 1, 2024. VITAL offers Stage 2 functionality for rollups, announced October 9, 2024. AVS-as-a-Service and the Wizard platform were announced on September 5, 2024, and BLITZ delivers a fast-finality network, launched November 29, 2024. The portfolio of modules demonstrates a broad approach to scalable, secure rollup deployments.\n\nProduct capabilities are complemented by verifiable AI tooling and accelerated AVS deployment capabilities. The team published releases on verifiable agents and the AVS Wizard, and announced a grant of 1,000,000 EIGEN tokens on December 19, 2024 to support continued work with EigenLayer. These efforts aim to bolster trusted AI integrations and secure AVS operations within the EigenLayer ecosystem.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Rollups-as-a-Service (RaaS)**: No-code and configurable panel for rapid deployment of custom rollup chains with support for multiple rollup stacks and VMs.\n- **Multi-stack Support (OP Stack, Arbitrum Orbit, Polygon CDK, Stark, and others)**: Publicly documented support for a range of stacks and integrations referenced in releases and updates.\n- **Restaked Rollups (MACH)**: The restaked rollup model leveraging EigenLayer for security, featuring MACH and Arbitrum One support as of July 1, 2024.\n- **VITAL (Stage-2 features for rollups)**: Module enabling Stage 2 rollup functionality, announced on October 9, 2024.\n- **AVS-as-a-Service (Wizard)**: Wizard platform for rapid deployment and management of AVS, announced on September 5, 2024.\n- **GoPlus AVS Mainnet**: GoPlus AVS mainnet launch noted on November 29, 2024, described as a security-focused AVS.\n- **BLITZ (fast-finality network)**: Fast finality solution for Orbit chains, announced and deployed on November 29, 2024.\n- **Verifiable AI / Verifiable Agents**: Tools for deploying AI agents in trusted environments with proof of correctness, discussed in 2024 publications.\n- **EigenLayer integration and grants**: AltLayer received a grant of 1,000,000 EIGEN tokens, announced December 19, 2024, with instructions for AVS operator registration in conjunction with EigenLayer.\n- **Tokenomics & Token Launch (ALT)**: Public ALT token launch with vesting adjustments announced on July 23, 2024 and the token launch on January 17, 2024.\n- **Documentation and operator guides (AVS/EigenLayer)**: Operational instructions for AVS operators and EigenLayer integration are publicly available in the project documentation.\n\n## Monad x Altlayer\n\nAltLayer’s roadmap documentation explicitly lists Monad and MegaETH as planned for support in Q3 2025, indicating an intended integration within its multi-stack offering. This reflects a forward-looking alignment to broaden cross-chain capabilities. Public materials also reference Monad and its founder Keone Hon in relation to AltLayer’s activities, including coverage of a Rollup Day event.\n\nMonad has published a Testnet Onboarding Guide in February 2025, confirming the existence of a public testnet and developer resources during that period. The cross-chain integration documentation lists several providers and bridges as supported on testnets, such as Chainlink CCIP, Garden, Hyperlane, LayerZero, and Wormhole, though AltLayer is not explicitly listed among supported providers on the public page. Based on the reviewed sources, the records show two clear facts: public mention of Monad in AltLayer materials and the roadmap commitment to Monad in 2025, but there are no joint press releases, official integrated launches, or simultaneous announcements on the official sites of Monad and AltLayer.",
