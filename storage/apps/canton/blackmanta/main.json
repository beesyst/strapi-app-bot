  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nBlack Manta Capital Partners is a fully licensed investment platform specializing in asset tokenization via the issuance of security tokens and conducting Security Token Offerings (STOs) under the full regulatory oversight of BaFin (Germany) and in accordance with MiFID II. Established in 2018, the company operates as an S.à r.l., signaling its foundation as a limited liability company, and from the outset, it has positioned itself as a comprehensive service provider covering the entire tokenization spectrum—from legal and financial advisory to technological implementation on the blockchain. Black Manta develops professional solutions for tokenizing a wide array of assets, ranging from real estate and funds to high-risk investment projects and innovative startups. A significant milestone in the company’s development was obtaining the BaFin license—the official confirmation of this status was granted on September 17, 2019—making Black Manta the first in Germany to execute a fully regulated STO utilizing smart contracts. Between 2019 and 2025, Black Manta has completed several major STO projects, including the tokenization of real estate in Frankfurt (36 apartments, offering launched in January 2025), the introduction of the Tokenization as a Service platform for investment funds in 2022, and the integration with leading European legal and compliance partners. Recently, the company was awarded the BSFZ Seal as an innovative R&D provider for the fintech sector in June 2024.\n\n## Functionality\n\nBlack Manta’s ecosystem revolves around the platform Tokenization as a Service®, which transforms legally enforceable rights to various assets into digital security tokens using blockchain technologies such as Ethereum and Polygon. The core features include developing and auditing smart contracts, issuing tokenized instruments, integrating with custodial providers, conducting KYC/AML procedures within the platform, and providing full legal support for each transaction—all in strict compliance with European and German securities legislation. The platform supports multi-asset and multi-jurisdiction structuring, enabling investors from different countries to acquire tokens representing equity, profit participation, or governance rights in the tokenized assets legally. For professional clients, Black Manta offers customized solutions for fund tokenization (creating fund tokens with subsequent listings and OTC trading), while private investors gain access to pre-vetted deals and automated profit distributions through smart contracts. The entire investment process is digital—from application and KYC verification to e-signature of documents and secure storage of security tokens either on custodial accounts or investors’ own wallets.\n\n## Features\n\n- **BaFin Regulation**: Full BaFin license for the distribution of security tokens.\n- **MiFID II Compliance**: Ensures adherence to the European MiFID II directive at every step of the transaction process.\n- **Tokenization as a Service®**: A comprehensive SaaS platform for legally significant tokenization of traditional and alternative assets.\n- **Multi-Asset & Multi-Jurisdiction**: Supports structuring transactions involving assets from different categories and regions simultaneously.\n- **Security Tokens**: Issuance of security tokens providing rights to equity, profit sharing, and governance.\n- **Smart Contracts**: Utilization of audited smart contracts for token issuance and income distribution automation.\n- **Integrated KYC/AML**: Complete digital identity verification and investor screening compliant with EU laws.\n- **Professional Asset Tokenization**: Solutions for tokenizing funds, real estate, startups, and corporate debt instruments.\n- **Legal Structuring**: Customization of transaction structures to meet national and European regulatory requirements for each asset type.\n- **Custodian Integrations**: Support for custodian services managing security tokens for both B2B clients and private investors.\n- **Instant Liquidity**: Enables early exit for investors via tradable security tokens with immediate liquidity options.\n- **Innovation Certified**: Awarded the German BSFZ Seal for Innovation, Research, and Development in June 2024.\n- **Partnership Ecosystem**: Collaborates with leading European legal, digital, and financial sector players from 2023 to 2025."
