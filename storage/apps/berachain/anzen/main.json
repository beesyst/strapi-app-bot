  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nAnzen is a decentralized protocol that issues USDz, an on‑chain currency backed by a diversified portfolio of real‑world assets, with the aim of integrating private credit markets into DeFi. The project markets USDz as a dollar backed by tokenized real assets and notes that the team has studied moving credit assets on‑chain since 2018. \n\nUSDz launched publicly in the summer of 2024, with sources indicating a June 2024 release. In the first months, the project reported TVL of roughly 90–92 million USD. The main site provides real‑time data on USDz turnover and on‑chain volume. \n\nThe native governance token ANZ underwent a public sale and distribution in December 2024. The fixed‑price sale began on December 2, 2024 through Fjord Foundry and Starship, with claim opportunities for buyers and airdrop recipients scheduled for December 9, 2024 at 08:08 AM EST. Anzen also announced a seed round totaling 4 million USD, with investors including Mechanism Capital, Circle Ventures, Frax, Arca and others.\n\n## Functionality\n\nThe product architecture rests on USDz being backed by an on‑chain portfolio of institutional private loans, represented through dedicated collateral tokens. Direct minting and redemption of USDz is available to authorized institutions after completing KYC and KYB, while retail holders obtain USDz via DEX liquidity provision and staking. \n\nTo support liquidity and peg stability, Anzen employs a dual liquidity system: continuous concentrated liquidity pools on a DEX for ordinary trading, and periodic quarterly buyback sessions that repurchase USDz 1:1 against USDC. The documented buyback dates are planned for January 7, 2025 and March 10, 2025. \n\nThe governance and incentive model relies on ANZ with a vote‑escrowed mechanism known as veANZ. Users lock ANZ to receive veANZ, which grants priority in buyback queues, voting rights on emissions, and access to exclusive features. ANZ is slated to launch on the Base chain, and USDz bridging across chains is implemented via LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token standard. The protocol has undergone audits, with comprehensive assessments completed in May 2024 by Halborn, Zellic, and PeckShield, and a separate ANZ audit noted in January 2025.\n\n## Features\n\n- **RWA‑backed Stablecoin USDz**: USDz is backed by a diversified portfolio of institutional private credits, with details on collateral and on‑chain asset representations available in project documentation.\n- **Multichain Bridging LayerZero OFT**: USDz is compatible with LayerZero OFT for rapid cross‑chain transfers, with launches on Mainnet, Base, Manta, Blast, and Arbitrum and plans for further networks.\n- **Dual Liquidity System**: Combines DEX‑concentrated pools for daily liquidity with quarterly on‑chain buyback queues for 1:1 redemptions against USDC, with scheduled buyback dates.\n- **OTC Market on Base and Ethereum**: On‑chain OTC market for USDz with priority and standard queues and a bonus APY for waiting in the queue.\n- **ANZ Tokenomics and veANZ Governance**: Total supply is 10 billion tokens; distribution includes airdrops, ecosystem allocation, investors and others; ANZ uses a ve model for governance and reward distribution.\n- **Audits and Security**: Smart contracts and releases were audited by Halborn, Zellic, and PeckShield in May 2024; detailed audit reports are published in project resources.\n- **USDz Vaults**: Fixed‑term USDz Vaults launched with predefined terms and yields, offering early exit options and tokenization of positions for the secondary market.\n- **Institutional Integrations and RWA Partners**: The protocol announces an expanded set of collateral providers, including Superstate funds, to improve liquidity and short‑term redemptions, with partnerships disclosed in blog posts and documentation.\n- **Seed Investors and Fundraising**: A seed round of 4 million USD involved Mechanism Capital, Circle Ventures, Frax, Arca and other funds.\n- **Protocol Transparency**: The project publishes audits, uses on‑chain queues for buybacks, and distributes airdrops and vested packages through Sablier and NFT representations for top wallets.\n\n## Berachain x Anzen\n\nOn November 21, 2024, Anzen published a blog post detailing Everything you need to know about USDZ, in which they stated that Phase 2 in 2025 would include expanding USDz and Anzen to multiple chains and partners, among them Berachain. This official post also confirms the planned release of ANZ and the launchpad, with the sale via Fjord Foundry and Starship scheduled for December 2, 2024 at 13:00 UTC and concluding on December 9, 2024 at 13:00 UTC. Public press releases around November 25, 2024 reiterated Anzen’s plans to launch USDz on additional networks, including Berachain. \n\nIn other official materials, Anzen indicated that USDz had already launched earlier, noting releases on Mainnet and networks such as Base, Manta, Blast, and Arbitrum, and that Berachain was included in the multi‑chain expansion. These statements appear on Anzen’s official site and related blog posts. \n\nA review of publicly indexed sources from official channels and Berachain’s news pages did not reveal an announced, live integration of USDz or ANZ on Berachain with a precise go‑live date. There is no Berachain release confirming live integration with a dated launch. The confirmed facts indicate that Anzen announced plans to bring USDz and ANZ to Berachain in Phase 2, with a December 2, 2024 ANZ TGE sale announcement and November 25, 2024 press coverage mentioning Berachain as a target; no Berachain‑side confirmation of a live integration date is found in official Berachain materials."
