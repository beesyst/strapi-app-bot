  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nClearpool is a decentralized lending marketplace focused on institutional unsecured liquidity, created by a team of professionals from traditional finance and the blockchain sector. The project secured seed funding of US$3 million, announced on September 29, 2021. This funding supported the early development of the protocol and its strategic partnerships.\n\nThe protocol officially launched on the Ethereum mainnet on March 23, 2022 and initially started with genesis borrower pools from market makers and trading firms such as Wintermute, Amber Group, and Folkvang. The pools and product mechanics are described in the protocol's official documentation. These mechanisms underpin the initial model and guide ongoing development.\n\n## Functionality\n\nClearpool implements a single-borrower liquidity pool model: each pool is linked to a single whitelisted borrower, and liquidity is provided by any connected lenders. The pool's interest rate dynamically adjusts based on capital utilization to balance supply and demand, and lenders receive cpTokens that accrue interest on each block.\n\nThe system also supports permissioned pools (institutional, with KYC/AML onboarding) through Clearpool Prime. The first permissioned pool, created in partnership with Jane Street and BlockTower Capital, was announced on May 3, 2022. The platform also includes a staking mechanism for CPOOL and an oracle network for voting on rate parameters, as well as multi-network integrations and bridges such as LayerZero for cross-chain bridging of CPOOL tokens announced on August 11, 2022.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Single-Borrower (Permissionless) Pools**: Each dynamic pool is tied to a specific whitelisted borrower and allows any user to provide liquidity and receive cpTokens; the interest rate automatically adjusts with utilization; the mainnet launch occurred on March 23, 2022.\n- **Permissioned Pools / Clearpool Prime**: Fixed-tenor pools with KYC/AML onboarding for institutional counterparties; the first public permissioned pool was announced on May 3, 2022 in partnership with Jane Street and BlockTower Capital.\n- **Dynamic Interest Model (utilization-driven)**: Rates in dynamic pools rise with higher capital utilization and fall with repayments; the model and its changes, including references to Cosine Curve, have been documented in the product roadmap.\n- **CPOOL — Utility & Governance**: The token has a fixed supply of 1,000,000,000; it is used for staking, boosting LP yields, and participating in governance and borrower assessment mechanisms.\n- **CPOOL Staking & Oracle Pools**: Native staking and delegated staking in oracle pools enable rewards and participation in rate pricing; staking details were updated on March 16, 2022.\n- **Multichain & Bridges**: The project expanded across networks, with Ethereum mainnet launch on 23 March 2022, Polygon PoS on 28 July 2022, LayerZero bridging on 11 August 2022, Polygon zkEVM on 31 July 2023, and subsequent launches on Optimism, Mantle, Avalanche, Flare, Base, and Arbitrum.\n- **Backend & Security (Audits)**: The protocol underwent external audits; MixBytes audited the permissionless protocol, while Hacken audited Credit Vaults (report January 17, 2024) and conducted a Smart Contract Assessment for Prime (January–February 2025 with final report February 25, 2025).\n- **Transparency of Metrics & Scale**: The protocol publicly displays aggregated metrics on its website, including total loans originated and TVL, with real-time figures shown in the interface.\n- **Investors & Early Partners**: The seed round of US$3 million included Sequoia Capital India, Arrington Capital, Sino Global Capital, HashKey, Hex Trust, and Wintermute among others, as confirmed by the project’s press release of September 29, 2021.",
