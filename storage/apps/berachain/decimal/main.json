  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nDecimal positions itself as \"Chain-Agnostic On-Demand Intent Execution\"—a platform for triggering conditional, programmable actions (intents) across blockchains using AI agents and hardware-backed security. The official resource describes the project as a trustless data marketplace for data and oracles, aimed at providing fast, inexpensive, and verifiable access to data for smart contracts and dApps.\n\nDecimal demonstrates a working alpha and notes that the product is alpha-live on Gnosis and Berachain; documentation and blog content are hosted in a GitBook wiki at wiki.decimal.at.\n\nThe founder listed on the site is Abhijat Sinha; the project also provides contacts, community channels (Discord, Telegram, X) and a media kit for partners and developers.\n\nThe official pages do not publish a founding date, release dates aside from the current alpha-live status, or publicly confirmed investment rounds or legally formalized partnerships; these details are not found on decimal.at or wiki.decimal.at.\n\n## Functionality\n\nArchitecture centers on Intents: developers or users formulate a desired state or condition and publish an Intent. A network of agents monitors external events and, when a trigger occurs, performs off-chain computations in a secure environment and returns results along with proofs of execution on-chain.\n\nThe system follows a Deploy → Monitor → Execute → Publish workflow: users deploy code or an intent, agents watch external events, computations happen off-chain in a protected environment, and the results and attestations are published on the blockchain.\n\nContract logic validates incoming data and the enclave attestation; the wiki states that the contract handles task payments and verifies enclave attestations to ensure computation correctness, with computations and payments settled in USDC.\n\nThe project emphasizes hardware security and low data provisioning costs, citing a benchmark of about $0.003/sec versus $3.00; developer documentation covers components such as Intent Specification, AI Module, Agents, and Secret Management.\n\nPublic postings on the official pages do not provide explicit founding dates, release dates, funding rounds, or legally confirmed partner agreements. These details are not found on decimal.at or wiki.decimal.at.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Chain-agnostic Intent Engine**: Executes conditional actions and orchestrates logic between different blockchains via the intent model, as described on the homepage and in the wiki.\n- **Permissionless Agents Network**: An agent network open to participants without a pre-approved white list for observing and executing intents.\n- **Hardware-Secured Execution & Enclave Attestation**: Off-chain execution tied to hardware attestation for correctness verified by the smart contract.\n- **On-Demand Feeds / Oracles**: Support for customizable oracles and on-demand data feeds enabling updates triggered by specified conditions.\n- **Programmable Intents (Developer Spec)**: Availability of intent specifications and developer sections (Intent Specification, AI Module, Agents, Contract) in the public wiki.\n- **Low-cost Data Provisioning**: Claims of low-cost data provisioning: $0.003/sec vs $3.00.\n- **USDC Settlement for Jobs**: Payments to agents and task settlement occur in USDC according to the contract logic.\n- **Developer Resources & Docs (GitBook)**: Comprehensive documentation, guides, and blogs hosted in the GitBook wiki.\n- **Alpha Deployments (Gnosis & Berachain)**: Alpha deployment status on Gnosis and Berachain.\n- **Media Kit & Brand Assets**: Official media kit with logos, color palette, and guidelines.\n\n## Berachain x Decimal\n\nThe Decimal home page states that Decimal is alpha-live on Berachain and on Gnosis, indicating public availability of Decimal services in alpha on these networks. The statement appears on the official site without accompanying dates or a press release on the same page.\n\nBerachain officially launched its mainnet on February 6, 2025; independent industry publications documented the mainnet launch on that date, noting a simultaneous Token Generation Event and network readiness.\n\nOn the Decimal main page, the claim of \"alpha-live on Berachain\" is not accompanied by a publication date or press link; the page provides links to wiki documentation and channels but does not specify an activation date.\n\nAcross the sources examined—the Decimal main page and industry launch reports—no additional official, dated announcements described detailed joint launches or roadmaps; the confirmed facts are Decimal's alpha presence on Berachain and Berachain's 2025-02-06 mainnet launch."
