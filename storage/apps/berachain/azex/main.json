  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nAZEx positions itself as a decentralized peer-to-pool perpetual DEX focused on routing funds within the Berachain ecosystem and on maximizing liquidity provider yields through integrations with DeFi protocols and staking mechanics. The official documentation describes auto-farming, permissionless listings, and social trading through copy trading, with the native AZT token underpinning the tokenomics. This combination frames AZEx as a platform that aligns capital deployment, earnings, and governance for Berachain participants.\n\nPublic artifacts include the official documentation, the project website, the testnet page, and a GitHub repository containing initial projects and architectural notes. DeFiLlama already shows the protocol as active with measurable TVL within the Berachain ecosystem, reflecting early liquidity interactions.\n\nAZEx launched a public testnet accompanied by an incentive campaign featuring tasks, bug bounties, and opportunities to earn tickets for an upcoming IDO. The official testnet was announced on December 5, 2024. The AZT token has a defined tokenomics framework with a total supply of 21,000,000,000 AZT, and an IAO/IDO was conducted from February 8 to February 11, 2025.\n\n## Functionality\n\nAZEx follows a peer-to-pool architecture where liquidity pools act as counterparties to traders, enabling instant order execution and reducing reliance on centralized order books. The official documentation details the advantages of this model along with risk-management mechanisms.\n\nThe platform implements automatic farming by reserving a portion of capital for trades and deploying the remaining funds into approved DeFi protocols to generate revenue. Profits are distributed to participants, including liquidity providers and stakers, in accordance with the protocol’s rules.\n\nFor trading, AZEx uses Smart Price Aggregation with external price oracles to verify prices and guard against manipulation. The system also offers on-chain copy trading and a Fund Manager model to delegate capital management and copy strategies through smart contracts.\n\nAZT tokenomics include a total supply of 21,000,000,000 AZT with distributions across categories such as team and advisors, ecosystem, community, and public sale, and the project has run an IAO/IDO in February 2025. The public testnet and incentive campaign were launched in December 2024, with further details published about tokenomics and governance.\n\nOpen-source artifacts and the public repository include architecture notes and runnable components. The GitHub organization hosts a README and project artifacts describing development tasks and system design.\n\nOn-chain revenue sharing and staking mechanisms distribute a portion of protocol revenue to AZT stakers and liquidity providers through staking and ve-like incentives, described in tokenomics and documentation.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Peer-to-Pool Counterparty Model**: Trades execute directly against multi-asset liquidity pools that act as counterparties, providing instant execution and reducing dependence on order-book matching; official documentation details the advantages and risk mechanisms.\n- **Auto Farming (Capital Deployment)**: The protocol maintains a small reserve for calculations and deploys the remainder of capital into permitted DeFi protocols to generate revenue, which is then distributed to participants.\n- **Permissionless Listing**: Markets and new token listings can be created without centralized approval; the feature is described in the documentation and contemplates integration with Uniswap V4 hooks if needed.\n- **On-chain Copy Trading & Fund Manager**: On-chain mechanics support copying trades and creating or investing in funds managed by external operators, all via smart contracts.\n- **Tokenomics — AZT (21,000,000,000 supply)**: AZT is used to create pools, launch tokens, serve as an entry fee for fund creation, and enable staking with revenue sharing; distribution covers Airdrop, Team & Advisors, Ecosystem, Community, IAO/Public Sale, and Reserve.\n- **Smart Price Aggregation & Oracle Verification**: Price data is sourced from external oracles and verified via mechanisms including Pyth, with indexing within permissible volatility.\n- **Public Testnet & Incentive Campaign (Dec 5—Dec 19, 2024)**: The official testnet launch and incentive program included tasks, bug bounties, and opportunities to earn tickets to an IDO; announced December 5, 2024 and detailed in official posts and testnet pages.\n- **Open Source Artifacts & Repo**: The official GitHub organization hosts a README and project artifacts describing architecture and tasks, with the repository publicly accessible.\n- **On-chain Revenue Share & Staking**: The protocol distributes a portion of revenue to all AZT stakers and LP through staking and ve-style incentives, as described in tokenomics and documentation.\n\n## Berachain x Azex\n\nBerachain officially includes AZEx in its ecosystem: on the Ecosystem page, AZEx is shown as part of Berachain’s ecosystem. AZEx describes itself as a perpetual DEX deeply integrated with Berachain mechanisms, noting that funds within the platform are intelligently routed to top DeFi protocols in the Berachain ecosystem.\n\nAZEx has consistently declared integration with Berachain and with Proof-of-Liquidity in public posts: AZEx published “AZEX: Integrating Proof-of-Liquidity for Enhanced DeFi Experience” on October 17, 2024; “Introducing AZBear NFTs: A Gateway to Exclusive AZEX Benefits” on November 5, 2024; and “AZEx: The Future of DeFi on Berachain” on November 27, 2024.\n\nFurther official steps include notes on AZEx incentivized testnet and mainnet milestones: a post titled “Introducing AZEx Incentivized Testnet” dated January 23, and another titled “AZEx Mainnet Live: Kickstart the $50K Trading Carnival” dated February 13; AZEx also provides an “AZEx Public Testnet” page detailing rules and the rewards program."
