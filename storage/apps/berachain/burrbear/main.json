  "contentMarkdown": "## Overview\n\nBurrBear positions itself as a One Stop Stablecoin Shop for the Berachain ecosystem, offering a set of pools and DEX functionality focused on stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets. The project emphasizes a cohesive toolkit to swap, provide liquidity, and manage stablecoin exposure within Berachain. Its product ecosystem is presented on the homepage as three product types: Multi Stable Pool, Burr Pool, and Generalized Pool. The official application domain is burrbear.io, and the site footer notes a 2024 copyright.\n\nOn the homepage, the project showcases three products — Multi Stable Pool, Burr Pool, and Generalized Pool — and identifies burrbear.io as the official domain. The site footer carries a 2024 copyright notice. BurrBear is described as providing tooling for stablecoin trading and liquidity within the Berachain ecosystem.\n\n## Functionality\n\nBurrBear implements Multi Stable Pools, modeled after the Composable Stable Pools approach, and introduces its own Burr Pool, described as delivering up to 20x higher capital efficiency for stablecoin trading. The design seeks to optimize liquidity provisioning and swap efficiency across stablecoins.\n\nThe project integrates with the Boyco mechanism within the Berachain ecosystem: upon depositing USDC, part of the funds is moved into local Berachain protocols, including minting NECT and conversion to HONEY. Liquidity is then provided in the NECT:HONEY:USDC three-pool. This flow is described in the Boyco markets overview and in the BurrBear integration repository.\n\nThe Multi Stable Pool contract set (NECT:HONEY:USDC) is described in a Reward Vault request, including the pool address, contract verification status, and a non-upgradable design. It also notes operational behavior, such as potential swap pauses while withdrawals remain available, and it cites liquidity and volume figures of approximately $4M TVL and $17M in volume as of February 25, 2025.\n\n## Features\n\n- **One‑Stop Stablecoin DEX**: Consolidated platform for trading and providing liquidity for stablecoins and tokenized real assets.\n- **Multi Stable Pools (Composable Stableswap‑style)**: Pools designed for classic USD:USD swaps and multi-stable baskets, implemented on the Composable StablePool approach.\n- **Burr Pools — 20x capital efficiency**: Own pool type, described as up to 20x more capital‑efficient for stablecoins than traditional methods.\n- **Generalized Pool (constant multi-token product)**: Support for classic multi-token AMM pools for arbitrary trading pairs.\n- **Integration with Boyco / Berachain**: Deposit zap mechanism and integration with Boyco markets to convert deposits into local strategies (mint NECT, convert to HONEY, and LP into the tri-pool).\n- **Deployment and contract verification — non-upgradable by design**: Contracts are verified and not expected to be upgradable, with emergency pause capabilities for swaps.\n- **Public data on pool and economics**: Public disclosures of pool address, TVL, volume, and requests to include in Reward Vaults for the Berachain ecosystem, with dates and amounts as of early 2025.\n- **Official domain and counterfeit UI warning**: Official domain burrbear.io; the project warns users not to interact with UI outside the official domain.\n- **Public sources / integration repositories**: Integration repository for Boyco-zaps exists on GitHub; the main BurrBear GitHub profile has no public product code repositories.\n- **Documentation, tokenomics and audits in GitBook**: Documentation, tokenomics, and audit references are available in the official GitBook.\n\n## Berachain x Burrbear\n\nBurrBear presents itself as a decentralized exchange focused on a one-stop stablecoin shop for the Berachain ecosystem; on the official site the project states that BurrBear is built to operate within Berachain and references the app and documentation. This positioning underscores BurrBear’s role as a core liquidity and trading layer for stablecoins on Berachain.\n\nIn Berachain’s official blog section on Boyco Markets Overview, BurrBear is listed among projects considered for Boyco—the pre-launch liquidity program. The material describes BurrBear’s model as a Stableswap Tri-Pool and its role in Berachain’s stablecoin markets.\n\nOn the BeraHub forum, BurrBear filed Reward Vault requests, including one for NECT:HONEY:USDC Multi Stable Pool dated February 26, 2025, with contact details and team reference. A Generalized (WBERA) pool request was registered on April 7, 2025, with subsequent edits and discussions reflecting ongoing governance activity.\n\nFurther posts in April and May 2025 document changes to controller addresses and third-token incentives, including contract details, pool addresses, and current TVL and liquidity, illustrating ongoing governance developments.\n\nIn official forum discussions, BurrBear and partners discussed a reward vault request for xSolvBTC/SolvBTC/WBTC Multi Stable Pool, with indications of community approval; a separate reward vault request for NECT:HONEY:USDC:USDT0 was registered on June 9, 2025, with updates discussed in the thread. External media reported a planned public LBP sale via Fjord Foundry around March 31, 2025, with coverage from industry outlets, though official confirmation should be drawn from BurrBear or Berachain announcements."
